    "In this project, we carry out topic modelling on a book chosen from the Gutenberg Project.  The Gensim package's tools for topic modelling are used instead of Scikit-Learn because Gensim provides the Coherence model and metrics for evaluating the topic models.  The metric of coherence which we use is known as NPMI (normalized Pointwise Mutual Information).  We also coded another metric which uses Word2Vec embeddings to compute the so-called c_w2v (where \"c\" stands for \"coherence\")."

Paragraphs are identified as portions of text which are divided by 3 or more newlines.  Next, we process the text with the steps: tokenization, lower-casing, removing stopwords, removing non-alphabetic tokens such as numerical information and punctuation, and finally, lemmatization.  We then remove \"documents\" which have fewer than 10 tokens.  This leaves us with a corpus of 99 documents."

      "the mercurial and aneroid barometers. Either of these instruments are\n",
      "quite sensitive to changes in the weight or pressure of the earth’s\n",
      "atmosphere, and from their variations we are able to draw conclusions\n",
      "relative to changes in the weather. Figs. No. 41 and 42 illustrate the\n",
      "standard mercurial and aneroid barometers used most extensively today. A\n",

      "                   THE MERCURIAL BAROMETER (Fig. 41)\n",
      "\n",
      "The mercurial barometer in use today is practically the same as that\n",
      "invented by Torricelli. Of course, many changes have been made in the\n",
      "case containing the tube of mercury, adding to its attractiveness, but\n",
      "the principle remains the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "The standard mercurial barometer consists of a straight glass tube about\n",
      "thirty-two or thirty-three inches in length, hermetically sealed at one\n",
      "end. The tube is of half-inch bore and is filled with chemically pure\n",
      "mercury, which has been boiled in the tube to insure the total exclusion\n",
      "of all air and moisture. After the tube has been filled, the open end is\n",
      "immersed in a cistern of mercury. Upon immersion the mercury drops in\n",
      "the tube to a height of 29.92 inches at sea level, or until\n",
      "counterbalanced by the weight of the surrounding atmosphere pressing\n",
      "upon the surface of the mercury in the cistern. The space in the top of\n",
      "the tube is a perfect vacuum and is called the Torricellian vacuum.\n",
      "\n",
      "The glass mercury tube is enclosed in a brass case. About two inches\n",
      "from the top of the case is an opening extending down the front and back\n",
      "for a distance of about eight inches. On each side of this opening is a\n",
      "graduated scale, one side being in inches and the other graduated in\n",
      "centimeters. The opening is fitted with a sliding vernier scale\n",
      "graduated in millimeters, thus permitting the reading of changes in the\n",
      "height of the mercury column most accurately, as the sliding vernier may\n",
      "be adjusted to the level of the mercury by means of a thumb screw fitted\n",
      "on the side of the case. The cistern containing the mercury is of glass,\n",
      "with a soft leather or chamois bottom and an adjusting screw, used to\n",
      "raise or lower the level of the mercury, so that it just comes in\n",
      "contact with a small ivory point, inserted in the top of the cistern,\n",
      "and which is used to mark the zero of the scale. Observations of the\n",
      "changes in the atmospheric pressure should be taken at regular\n",
      "intervals, and it is necessary to adjust the height of the mercury in\n",
      "the cistern before each observation. This is done by bringing the ivory\n",
      "point in contact with the level of the mercury and then bringing the\n",
      "vernier scale absolutely level with the top of the column of mercury in\n",

    "#### Comments on Coherence Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above table of coherence results, we see that BoW models have higher NMPI scores than their Tf-idf counterparts.  But the pattern is reverse for the W2v score: the Tf-idf models have better W2V scores than their BoW counterparts. \n",
    "\n",
    "On manual inspection of the topics and topic words, we see that for Tf-idf models, rarer words like \"barometer\", \"electricity\", \"aneroid\" are brought to the places of greater significance within topics.  This helps us in identifying labels for the topics.  On the other hand, BoW models seem to be better at bringing out general themes.  For example, the LDA-BoW model, which has the best NMPI score, has many topics headed by the words \"weather\" and \"air\".  The NMP-Tfidf model, which has the highest W2V score, has many specific topic words such as \"vane\", and \"mercury\".\n",

    "## 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has  explored topic modelling on an ebook from the Gutenberg Project.  The models were: LDA, NMF, and LSI.  Two coherence metrics, NPMI and a word2vec-based metric, were used for automatic evaluation of the results of topic models. According to the evaluation by metrics, LDA was best in extracting general themes/topics from BoW data, while NMF performed best among the models extracting topics from TF-IDF data. The NMF topics were found to more specific as compared to the topics generated by LDA.\n",
