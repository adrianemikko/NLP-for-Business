Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the labeling only listed cerebral vascular accidents. \"Unexpected,\" as used in this definition, refers to an adverse experience that has not been previously observed (i.e., included in the labeling) rather than from the perspective of such experience not being anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the pharmaceutical product.   Call report: A list of all questions, requests for circulars, and physician/patient complaints received by SCIEN's Clinical Support Department is prepared monthly by SCIEN staff and is forwarded to HEMISPHERX RA/QA Department.   Audit: A systematic examination of processes, controls and systems, operating procedures, reports, records and/or data to assess SCIEN's compliance with standards, regulatory submissions, SOPs; applicable laws, regulations, directives, standards and guidelines; the terms of this Agreement and other contracts in place defining the services being provided and to verify data integrity.   Good Clinical Practices (\"GCPs\"): Good clinical practice (GCP) is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting trials that involve the participation of human subjects. Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and wellbeing of trial subjects are protected, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that the clinical trial data are credible. ICH Guidance for Industry: E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance.   Good Manufacturing Practices (\"GMPs\"): The recognized pharmaceutical regulations and requirements of regulatory authorities such as those defined by the U.S. FDA's regulations at 21CFR Parts 210 and 211.   Key Contacts: Persons at SCIEN and HEMISPHERX assigned to assure proper communication and follow-up in a timely manner within both parties' organizations. Names, titles and full contact information for Key Contacts shall be appended to this Agreement as Attachment 1 and should be maintained up-to-date during the course of the project.   Observation: A statement of fact made during an audit that is substantiated by objective evidence. HEMISPHERX categorizes observations as follows:   o Critical: May pose risk to patient or consumer or otherwise compromise the integrity or quality of the material, product, process, or service being provided. Other instances that could be defined as a critical observation include: A practice that poses an immediate safety risk to personnel; Quality System(s) missing or not in compliance with regulations, guidelines, or corporate policies. {***} Confidential portions of this exhibit have been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a confidential treatment request in accordance with Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.   Page 19 of 28   o Major: Does not fully comply with regulations, guidelines or corporate policies and may pose unnecessary risks to the integrity or quality of material, product, process or service being provided.

Upon prior written notice, Distributor will provide reasonable access to such records during normal business hours at Distributor's office. Distributor agrees to maintain all such records for a minimum of three years. 12.

All such uses are subject to Tripath's prior review and consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 14.2 All use of Tripath trademarks and service marks will be in proper form, giving appropriate attribution to Tripath as the owner of the mark. Distributor will not undertake any use of a mark in a manner that might jeopardize Tripath's rights to use or register such mark, or Tripath's rights to prevent unauthorized use. Distributor will promptly notify Tripath of any acts of unfair competition or trade or service mark infringement, and reasonably cooperate with efforts to protect Tripath's rights. 14.3 All use of Tripath trade marks and service marks by Distributor will inure to the benefit of Tripath, and Distributor will reasonably cooperate, at Tripath's expense with Tripath's efforts to register or otherwise secure rights in such marks. Upon termination of this Agreement, Distributor will immediately cease all further use of Tripath's trademarks, trade names or service marks except as may be required in the sale of Products in inventory. 15. Relationship Between the Parties 15.1 Both Distributor and Tripath are independent contractors, and no agency or other joint relationship is created. 15.2 Neither party has any authority to act for and/or to bind the other in any way, or to represent that either is in any way responsible for the acts of the other. 16. Confidentiality 16.1 Confidential information (\"Information\") of Tripath and/or Distributor will mean information that the disclosing party desires to protect against unauthorized use or disclosure, and which is furnished under this Agreement as follows: (a) written or other tangible information clearly marked with a notice, such as -5- Distributor Agreement \"CONFIDENTIAL\"; and (b) oral information that is identified at the time of disclosure as being confidential. Confidential Information will not include information that: (a) enters the public domain without a breach of this Agreement, (b) is known to the recipient prior to the time of disclosure, or is independently developed by the recipient without using any Information, or (c) is obtained from another source that the receiving party has no reasonable cause to believe is under any obligation of confidentiality with respect to Information. 16.2 The recipient of Information will treat it as proprietary and confidential, safeguarding the Information at least as carefully as it would its own confidential information, and will use all reasonable efforts to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure, including restricting access to the Information within its organization and ensuring that its employees comply with this Agreement. A receiving party will not disclose any information to any third party without prior written consent. Either party learning of any unauthorized use or disclosure of any Information will promptly notify the other party, and will reasonably cooperate with efforts to protect such Information. 16.3 The recipient of information will use it only in the furtherance of the business relationship established by this Agreement, and for no other purpose without prior written consent. All Information will remain the property of the disclosing party, and will be returned or destroyed upon written request. 16.4 The confidentiality obligations in this Agreement will be binding during the Agreement and for a period of three years after any termination or non-renewal of the Agreement. 16.5 Neither party will disclose the existence or terms of this Agreement without prior written consent. 17. Export Control 17.1 Distributor will not engage in exporting activities within the Territory without the prior written approval of Tripath, and the United States Government if such approval is necessary. Nothing in this Subsection is meant to authorize Distributor shipments outside the Territory. 17.2 Distributor understands that the Products and Tripath confidential information are restricted by the United States Government from export to certain countries, and Distributor agrees that it will not sell or license Products or transfer Tripath confidential information in any way will violate any of the export control laws or regulations of the United States. 18. Term and Termination 18.1 The terms of this Agreement shall be one year from the effective date and will be automatically renewed on each anniversary of the effective date, for a renewal term of one year unless either party provides written notification of its intention not to renew this Agreement at least one month prior to the expiration of the initial or any renewal terms. Tripath will honor all orders acknowledged prior to the effective date of any such termination by nonrenewable. 18.2 Tripath or Distributor may terminate this Agreement for any reason with thirty days written notice. 18.3 Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately if the other party becomes insolvent, or takes any steps to make an arrangement with its creditors, or has a receiver appointed. 18.4 If Tripath terminates pursuant to Subsection 18.1 or 18.2, or if Distributor terminates pursuant to Subsection 18.3, Tripath will purchase and Distributor will resell to Tripath Distributor's inventory of Products (excluding -6- Distributor Agreement discontinued and demonstration Products) which Tripath determines to be undamaged and in good condition (including, at Tripath's option on-site inspection). The price for such inventory will be the price actually paid by the Distributor, less any prior credit or allowances. 18.5 If Distributor terminates pursuant to Subsection 18.1 or 18.2, or if Tripath terminates pursuant to Subsection 18.3, Tripath may, at its option, purchase and Distributor will resell to Tripath all or part of Distributor's inventory at the price set forth in Subsection 18.4, less a ten percent restocking charge. 18.6 On termination of this Agreement for whatever cause, Distributor will immediately (a) cease to engage in marketing and distribution activities as Tripath's official distributor, and (b) cease representing in any manner that it is a distributor of Tripath Products in the Territory. 18.7 All obligations of Distributor to make payments under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement for whatever cause, along with the following provisions: Section 10 (Limited Warranty), Section 11 (Reports and Audits), Section 16 (Confidentiality), Section 17 (Export Control), Section 19 (Intellectual Property Indemnity), and Subsection 21.6 (Governing Law), and Subsection 21.7 (Arbitration). 19. Intellectual property indemnity 19.1 Indemnification. Distributor agrees that Tripath has the right to, and Tripath agrees that it will at its expense, defend or at its option settle any claim, suit, proceeding, or other action brought against Distributor or its customer for infringement of any United States copyright, trademark or other United States intellectual property right related to the Products or their use, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section. Tripath will have sole control of any such action or settlement negotiations (Tripath will not be liable for any costs or expenses incurred without its prior written authorization), and Tripath will pay any final judgment entered against Distributor or its customer based on such infringement. Tripath at its sole option will be relieved of the foregoing obligations unless Distributor or its customer notifies Tripath promptly in writing of such action and gives Tripath full information and assistance to settle and/or defend any such action. If it is adjudicated that a Product infringes, or if the sale or use of a Product is, as a result, enjoined, then Tripath will, at its option and expense either: (i) procure for Distributor and its customers the right to sell or use the Product; or (ii) replace the Product with other suitable Product; or (iii) suitably modify the Product to be noninfringing; or (iv) if none of the foregoing are commercially reasonable, as determined by Tripath, accept return of the affected Products and refund Distributor's aggregate payments for such Products, less a reasonable sum for use and/or damage, if any. 19.2 Limitation. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 19.1, Tripath assumes no liability for, and Distributor agrees to indemnify Tripath to the same extent as Tripath's indemnity under Section 19.1 for: (i) any infringements covering completed equipment or any assembly, circuit, combination, or method in which any of the Products may be used but not covering such Products standing alone; or (ii) any trademark infringements involving any marking or branding not applied by Tripath or involving any marking or branding applied at the request of Distributor; or (iii) any modification of the Products unless such modification was made by Tripath. 19.3 Entire Liability. The foregoing provisions of this section 19 state the entire liability and obligations of Tripath and the exclusive remedy of Distributor and its customers, with respect to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement by the Products. 20. Limitation of Liability 20.1 Neither Tripath nor Distributor will be liable for any incidental or consequential -7- Distributor Agreement damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or other pecuniary loss) arising out of this Agreement, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. 21. General 21.1 Assignment. This Agreement is not assignable by Distributor without prior written consent of Tripath, which will not be unreasonably withheld. Tripath is free to assign this contract without Distributor's consent. 21.2 Modifications. This Agreement may be modified only in writing signed by an officer of each party. 21.3 Headings. The headings of the several Sections are inserted for convenience of reference only, and are not intended to be part of nor to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 21.4 Notices. All notices under this Agreement will be sent by receipted courier (e.g., U.P.S.). 21.5 Non-Waiver. The failure of either party to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of the right of such party to subsequently enforce any such provisions or a waiver of the provision itself. 21.6 Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of California, without reference to conflicts of laws. 21.7 Arbitration. Any dispute or claim arising out of this Agreement will be referred to and resolved by the International Chamber of Commerce (\"ICC\") in accordance with the ICC Arbitration Rules. The venue for such arbitration will be Santa Clara County, California, USA. -8- Distributor Agreement This Agreement supersedes all proposals, oral or written, all negotiations, or discussions between or among the parties relating to this Agreement, and all past course of dealing or industry custom. This Agreement takes precedence over the terms of any Tripath or Distributor order or sales documentation, including the Tripath Sales Order Acknowledgment.

       "      <td>Exhibit (8)(k)(k) SERVICE AGREEMENT This Agreement is entered into and effective as of the 1st day of January, 1998, by and between FIDELITY INVESTMENTS INSTITUTIONAL OPERATIONS COMPANY, INC. (\"FIIOC\") and NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY CORPORATION (\"Company\"). WHEREAS, FIIOC provides transfer agency and other services to Fidelity's Variable Insurance Products Fund, Variable Insurance Products Fund II and Variable Insurance Products Fund III (collectively \"Funds\"); and WHEREAS, the services provided by FIIOC on behalf of the Funds include responding to inquiries about the Funds including the provision of information about the Funds' investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, etc.; and WHEREAS, Company holds shares of the Funds in order to fund certain variable annuity contracts, group annuity contracts, and/or variable life insurance policies, the beneficial interests in which are held by individuals, plan trustees, or others who look to Company to provide information about the Funds similar to the information provided by FIIOC; and WHEREAS, the Company and one or more of the Funds have entered into one or more Participation Agreements, under which the Company agrees not to provide information about the Funds except for information provided by the Funds or their designees; and WHEREAS, FIIOC and Company desire that Company be able to respond to inquiries about the Funds from individual variable annuity owners, participants in group annuity contracts issued by the Company, and owners and participants under variable life insurance policies issued by the Company, and prospective customers for any of the above; and WHEREAS, FIIOC and Company recognize that Company's efforts in responding to customer inquiries will reduce the burden that such inquiries would place on FIIOC should such inquiries be directed to FIIOC. NOW, THEREFORE, the parties do agree as follows: 1. Information to be Provided to Company. FIIOC agrees to provide to Company, on a periodic basis, directly or through a designee, information about the Funds' investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, performance, etc. The content and format of such information shall be as FIIOC, in its sole discretion, shall choose. FIIOC may change the format and/or content of such informational reports, and the frequency with which such information is provided. For purposes of Section 4.2 of each of the Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, FIIOC represents that it is the designee of the Funds, and Company may therefore use the information provided by FIIOC without seeking additional permission from the Funds. 2. Use of Information by Company. Company may use the information provided by FIIOC in communications to individuals, plan trustees, or others who have legal title or beneficial interest in the annuity or life insurance products issued by Company, or representatives of any of these parties, and to prospective purchasers of such products or beneficial interests thereunder. If such information is contained as part of larger pieces of sales literature, advertising, etc., such pieces shall be furnished for review to the Funds in accordance with the terms of the Company's Participation Agreements with the Funds. Nothing herein shall give the Company the right to expand upon, alter the appearance of, or otherwise alter the information provided by FIIOC. Company acknowledges that the information provided it by FIIOC may need to be supplemented with additional qualifying information, regulatory disclaimers, or other information before it may be conveyed to persons outside the Company. 3. Compensation to Company. In recognition of the fact that Company will respond to inquiries that otherwise would be handled by FIIOC, FIIOC agrees to pay Company a quarterly fee computed as follows: At the close of each calendar quarter, FIIOC will determine the Average Daily Assets held in the Funds by the Company. Average Daily Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter divided by the number of calendar days in the quarter. The Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that sum shall be divided by four. The resulting number shall be the quarterly fee for that quarter, which shall be paid to Company during the following month. Should any Participation Agreement(s) between Company and any Fund(s) be terminated effective before the last day of a quarter, Company shall be entitled to a fee for that portion of the quarter during which the Participation Agreement was still in effect, unless such termination is due to misconduct on the part of the Company. For such a stub quarter, Average Daily Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter through and including the date of termination of the Participation Agreement(s), divided by the number of calendar days in that quarter for which the Participation Agreement was in effect. Such Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that number shall be multiplied by the number of days in such quarter that the Participation Agreement was in effect, then divided by three hundred sixty-five. The resulting number shall be the quarterly fee for the stub quarter, which shall be paid to Company during the following month. Notwithstanding the foregoing, compensation for each calendar quarter will not exceed [ ]. 4. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by Company at any time upon written notice to FIIOC. FIIOC may terminate this Agreement at any time upon ninety (90) days' written notice to Company. FIIOC may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to Company (1) if required by any applicable law or regulation, (2) if so required by action of the Fund(s) Board of Trustees, or (3) if Company engages in any material breach of this Agreement. This Agreement shall terminate immediately and automatically upon the termination of Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, and in such event no notice need be given hereunder. 5. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be construed and the provisions hereof interpreted under and in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 6. Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned without the written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, except that it shall be assigned automatically to any successor to FIIOC as the Funds' transfer agent, and any such successor shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have set their hands as of the date first written above. FIDELITY INVESTMENTS INSTITUTIONAL OPERATIONS COMPANY, INC.

The proposed  implementation  plan and terms and  conditions          shall be submitted to the General Committee for approval. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 2, 1998                                                        Page 15 11.2     If  subsequent  to the RFCS Date,  the  Design  Capacity  is  decreased          pursuant to the  agreement of the Managing  Group and such  decrease of          the Design Capacity affects neither the routing of circuits assigned in          TAT-14  nor the Sold  Capacity  of  TAT-14,  the  reduction  in  Design          Capacity will be subtracted  from the CRC as determined by the Managing          Group. 11.3     In the event that the capacity which TAT-14, or any Segment thereof, is          capable of providing is reduced below the capacity  required to support          the Sold  Capacity on its  existing or planned  routings as a result of          physical deterioration,  or for other reasons beyond the control of the          Parties,  the  Managing  Group shall  initiate a review of the capacity          routings in order to support the  rerouting of such Sold  Capacity.  If          necessary,  the Managing Group may further consider changes to capacity          assignments. 11.4     Financial  adjustments  shall be made among the Parties,  as necessary,          under  terms  and  conditions  recommended  by the  Managing  Group and          approved by the General Committee. 12       OWNERSHIP PRICING 12.1     The TAT-14 Initial Ownership Pricing Matrix is shown in Annex 8. 12.2     In the event that the final  cost of TAT-14 is lower  than the  initial          budget, each Party's investment shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis in          accordance  with Schedule B, with no change to its Allocated  Capacity.          If the final  cost of TAT-14 is higher  than the  initial  budget  each          Party's investment shall be increased on a pro-rata basis in accordance          with Schedule B.

Such costs shall also                 include costs incurred by the Parties in holding the meetings of                 the Managing Group, the Procurement Group and its Working Groups                 and   the   preparation   and   attendance   by   the   Parties'                 representatives at such meetings. 13.2     Capital  costs shall  exclude  costs  incurred  by the Parties  holding          meetings  of the AR&amp;R  Subcommittee  and F&amp;A  Subcommittee  established          pursuant to Subparagraph 7.2 of this Agreement or the attendance by the          Parties' representatives at such meetings. 13.3     Any  amounts  received  by,  or  credited  to,  a Party or the CBP as a          consequence  of  letters of  guarantee,  liquidated  damages,  or other          similar  amounts  resulting  from the failure of the  Supplier to fully          perform  any  provision  of the Supply  Contract,  shall  accrue to the          benefit of all the Parties in accordance with Schedule B. 13.4     The cost of repair or replacement of any part of TAT-14 in the event of          damage or loss arising during construction, laying, burying, installing          and the bringing into operation of TAT-14,  which is attributable under          the Supply  Contract to the  Parties,  shall be regarded as part of the          capital costs for the purpose of Subparagraph  13.1. Any of the Parties          may at its own  expense  insure  against  such  risks so far as its own          share of costs is concerned. Should the Managing Group agree to jointly          insure against such risks, the cost of such insurance will form part of          the capital costs referred to in Subparagraph 13.1. 14       ALLOCATION AND BILLING OF SEGMENTS CAPITAL COSTS 14.1     The capital  costs of Segment S of TAT-14,  as defined in Paragraph 13,          including any additional  work or property  incorporated  subsequent to          the RFPA Date - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 2, 1998                                                        Page 17          by  agreement  of the  Parties,  shall be borne by the  Parties  in the          proportions set forth in Schedule B. 14.2     The CBP will receive  invoices  from the Supplier for the costs due and          included in the Supply  Contract.  The Parties  shall  promptly  render          invoices to the CBP for the cost of items directly  incurred by them in          accordance with Subparagraph  13.1. The CBP shall promptly render bills          to each of the Parties for such Party's pro rata share of costs due and          included in the invoices it has received in accordance with Schedule B.          Such bills shall contain a reasonable  amount of detail to substantiate          them.  On the basis of such bills,  each Party shall pay to the CBP the          amount  owed  within  forty-five  (45)  days from the date the bill was          rendered by the CBP in the currency shown on the respective bill. 14.3     For the purpose of this Agreement, financial charges shall be computed,          as appropriate,  at a rate equal to the lowest publicly announced prime          rate  or  minimum  commercial  lending  rate,  however  described,  for          ninety-day  loans on the 1st working day of each month of the period to          be  considered  in the Country and in the currency in which the bill is          rendered.  With respect to the Parties  rendering  invoices  under this          Agreement,  Annex 7 specifies those rates. If the Managing Group should          authorize a Party in a Country other than those Parties listed in Annex          7 to render  invoices,  the Managing Group shall specify the applicable          rates. 14.4     For the  purposes of this  Agreement,  \"paid\" shall mean that the funds          are available for immediate use by the recipient. 14.5     Bills not paid when due shall accrue extended  payment charges from the          day  following  the date on which  payment was due in  accordance  with          Subparagraph  14.2 until the day on which it is paid.  For the purposes          of this Agreement, extended payment charges shall be computed at a rate          equal to 150 % of the  appropriate  financial  charges as  indicated in          Subparagraph 14.3 on the day following the date payment of the bill was          due. In the event that applicable law allows the imposition of extended          payment  interest  charges only at a rate less than that established in          accordance with this Subparagraph, extended payment charges shall be at          the  highest  rate  permitted  by such  applicable  law.  In this case,          appropriate  documents to  demonstrate  the  applicability  of such law          shall be provided by the concerned Party. 14.6     Extended payment charges recovered by the CBP, in excess of the amounts          paid or due, excluding interest paid by whichever Party or Parties have          covered  the deficit in the  intervening  period,  shall  accrue to the          benefit of all the Parties in accordance with Schedule B. 14.7     Procedures for rendering  credits for refunds of appropriate  financial          charges and bills for extended payment charges will be developed by the          CBP in conjunction with the F&amp;A Subcommittee. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 2, 1998                                                        Page 18 14.8     As soon as practicable  after the RFPA Date, the amount of each Party's          share of the costs of Segment S shall be computed by the CBP which will          make appropriate  adjustments and render any necessary bills or arrange          for any necessary refunds by way of final settlement in order that each          Party  may  bear its  appropriate  share of the  costs as  provided  in          Subparagraph 14.1. 14.9     A bill shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Party to whom it is          rendered if that Party does not present a written  objection to the CBP          on or before  fifteen  (15) days prior to the date when payment is due.          If such  objection  is made,  the  Parties  concerned  shall make every          reasonable effort to settle promptly the dispute concerning the bill in          question.  If the  objection is sustained and the billed Party has paid          the  disputed  bill,  the agreed  upon  overpayment  shall be  refunded          promptly to the objecting  Party by the billing Party together with any          financial charges calculated thereon at a rate determined in accordance          with  Subparagraph  14.3 of this  Agreement from the date of payment of          the  bill  to the  date on  which  the  refund  is  transmitted  to the          objecting Party. If the objection is not sustained and the billed Party          has not paid the disputed bill,  said Party will pay such bill promptly          together with any extended payment charges calculated thereon at a rate          determined in accordance with  Subparagraph 14.5 of this Agreement from          the day  following  the date on which payment of the bill was due until          paid.  Nothing in this  Subparagraph  shall relieve a Party from paying          those parts of a bill that are not in dispute.  The  provisions of this          Subparagraph  shall be  without  prejudice  to the  rights of any Party          pursuant to Paragraph 21 of this Agreement. 15       TRANSIT FACILITIES TO EXTEND TAT-14 CAPACITY AND CONNECTION WITH INLAND          SYSTEMS 15.1     The Terminal  Parties shall use all  reasonable  efforts to furnish and          maintain, or cause to be furnished and maintained, in working order for          the other Parties and for the Purchasers in TAT-14, for the duration of          this Agreement,  the necessary facilities in their respective Countries          as may be reasonably required for extending capacity in TAT-14 assigned          to  such   Parties  or   Purchasers   for  the   purpose  of   handling          communications  transiting  the  Country  involved.

At mutually agreed upon times, HEMISPHERX may review standard operating and other quality control procedures and records and the records of SCIEN relating to the Agreement. Such routine and general oversight review is to be requested at least twenty (20) business days in advance, limited to two (2) persons, completed within one (1) to two (2) business days and shall be offered to HEMISPHERX one (1) time each calendar year. SCIEN will make every reasonable effort to accommodate the special circumstances that may arise pursuant to \"for cause\" audits. The following applies to all audits:   · Prior to an audit HEMISPHERX will communicate to SCIEN the scope of the audit. · HEMISPHERX will prepare a written report of the results of the audit and forward a copy to SCIEN.   SCIEN will provide a written response to HEMISPHERX's written audit report within twenty (20) business days of receipt of such report setting forth the corrective actions to be taken by SCIEN, if any, and a timeline for such implementation.   In the event of an inspection by any governmental or regulatory authority concerning the activities carried out under the Agreement, SCIEN shall notify HEMISPHERX promptly upon learning of such an inspection, shall supply HEMISPHERX with copies of any correspondence or portions of correspondence relating to HEMISPHERX's materials and shall inform HEMISPHERX of the general findings and outcomes of such inspections.

Definitions   Adverse experience: Any adverse event associated with the use of a biological or drug product in humans, whether or not considered product related, including the following: an adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a biological or drug product in professional practice; an adverse event occurring from overdose of the product whether accidental or intentional; an adverse event occurring from abuse of the product; an adverse event occurring from withdrawal of the product; and any failure of expected pharmacological action.   Disability: A substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions.   Life-threatening adverse experience: Any adverse experience that places the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred, i.e., it does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.   Labeled event: An adverse experience that is listed on the product insert as having been observed in patients who are receiving the drug product. {***} Confidential portions of this exhibit have been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a confidential treatment request in accordance with Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.   Page 18 of 28   Drug Product: A finished dosage form, for example, tablet, capsule, or solution that contains an active ingredient generally, but not necessarily, in association with inactive ingredients   Serious adverse experience: Any adverse experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening adverse experience, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.   Unexpected adverse experience: Any adverse experience that is not listed in the current labelling for the biological or drug product. This includes events that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labelling, but differ from the event because of greater severity or specificity.   For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the labeling only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the labeling only listed cerebral vascular accidents. \"Unexpected,\" as used in this definition, refers to an adverse experience that has not been previously observed (i.e., included in the labeling) rather than from the perspective of such experience not being anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the pharmaceutical product.   Call report: A list of all questions, requests for circulars, and physician/patient complaints received by SCIEN's Clinical Support Department is prepared monthly by SCIEN staff and is forwarded to HEMISPHERX RA/QA Department.   Audit: A systematic examination of processes, controls and systems, operating procedures, reports, records and/or data to assess SCIEN's compliance with standards, regulatory submissions, SOPs; applicable laws, regulations, directives, standards and guidelines; the terms of this Agreement and other contracts in place defining the services being provided and to verify data integrity.   Good Clinical Practices (\"GCPs\"): Good clinical practice (GCP) is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting trials that involve the participation of human subjects. Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and wellbeing of trial subjects are protected, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that the clinical trial data are credible. ICH Guidance for Industry: E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance.   Good Manufacturing Practices (\"GMPs\"): The recognized pharmaceutical regulations and requirements of regulatory authorities such as those defined by the U.S. FDA's regulations at 21CFR Parts 210 and 211.   Key Contacts: Persons at SCIEN and HEMISPHERX assigned to assure proper communication and follow-up in a timely manner within both parties' organizations. Names, titles and full contact information for Key Contacts shall be appended to this Agreement as Attachment 1 and should be maintained up-to-date during the course of the project.   Observation: A statement of fact made during an audit that is substantiated by objective evidence. HEMISPHERX categorizes observations as follows:   o Critical: May pose risk to patient or consumer or otherwise compromise the integrity or quality of the material, product, process, or service being provided. Other instances that could be defined as a critical observation include: A practice that poses an immediate safety risk to personnel; Quality System(s) missing or not in compliance with regulations, guidelines, or corporate policies. {***} Confidential portions of this exhibit have been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a confidential treatment request in accordance with Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.   Page 19 of 28   o Major: Does not fully comply with regulations, guidelines or corporate policies and may pose unnecessary risks to the integrity or quality of material, product, process or service being provided. Other instances that could be defined as a major observation include: Likely or probable safety risk to personnel; Quality System(s) weak or needing improvement; repeated Minor deficiencies of a similar nature that indicate a systemic problem and therefore may be classified as Major. o Minor: Does not comply with regulations, guidelines, or corporate policies but does not directly impact the integrity or quality of the material, product, process, or service being provided. o Comment: Compliant with regulations, guidelines and/or corporate policies; however, the auditor comment serves as a recommendation relative to maintaining or improving a specific condition noted.   Out-of-Specification / Out-of-Trend (\"OOS / \"OOT\"): A result that is not within the established specifications or trend, whether these are qualitative or quantitative.   Standard Operating Procedures (\"SOPs\"): Procedures in effect at SCIEN that define the processes and controls by and under which activities are to be conducted to assure compliance with the appropriate Code of Federal Regulations.   7. Communications   To assure proper communication, notification and follow-up in a timely manner by both parties, \"Key\" contacts are listed in Attachment 1 of this Agreement. Key contacts shall have access to project managers and technical staff and, upon reasonable notice and as required, facilitate resolution of any issues. Every effort will be made by SCIEN to accommodate timely communications, including face-to-face meetings, with HEMISPHERX.   8. Change of Control   SCIEN will maintain and follow change control SOP(s) to ensure that changes to equipment, procedures, processes, etc. occur in a controlled manner and in compliance with requirements e defined by the U.S. FDA's regulations (see Section 2).

(\"Tripath\"), and Uniquest Corporation 780 Montague Expressway Suite 406 Santa Jose, CA 95131 Tripath and Distributor intend to establish Distributor as a non-exclusive Distributor for Tripath products in the following designated Territory, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Korea 1. Products 1.1 \"Products\" means the Tripath semiconductor products identified by Tripath in writing from time to time. 1.2 Tripath may discontinue manufacture or sale, or otherwise treat as obsolete, any or all of the Products covered by this Agreement upon thirty days written notice. 2. Appointment and Term 2.1 For the term of this Agreement, Tripath appoints Distributor as a non-exclusive distributor for the Products in the Territory, subject to Tripath's direct sales activities under Section 4. 2.2 Distributor will use best efforts to develop the local market and promote the sales of Products within the Territory. Distributor will not sell outside the Territory without Tripath's prior written permission, which will not be unreasonably withheld. 2.3 After one month's written notice, Tripath may in its discretion amend (i) the Products, and/or (ii) the Territory. 2.4 Tripath reserves the right to appoint other distributors in or out of the Territory who may sell into the Territory. 2.5 Distributor's appointment is for a term of one year from the Effective Date, renewable automatically unless terminated under Section 18 3. Distributor Responsibilities 3.1 Distributor will maintain an adequately trained sales organization, capable of fulfilling its obligation under Subsection 2.2. 3.2 Tripath will furnish technical and marketing information (such as sales aids and Distributor Agreement literature, data sheets, application notes, etc.) for the Products, and Distributor will maintain an organized and well stocked collection of such technical and marketing information for distribution to prospective customers. 3.3 Distributor will employ sufficient trained personnel (\"Application Engineers\") to provide technical and marketing support for Tripath's Products. Distributor and Tripath will cooperate to ensure that the Application Engineers are and remain adequately trained and qualified. 3.4 Distributor will maintain a reasonable number of Demonstration Products (customer samples), with appropriate technical and marketing literature, available for demonstration by knowledgeable Distributor personnel, provided that Distributor must obtain prior approval by Tripath before any customer receives demonstration Products (customer samples). 3.5 Distributor has no authorization to make, and will not make, any guarantee or warranty with respect to any Product — all Product warranties are to be communicated to Customers directly by Tripath in writing. Distributor will make no representations as to quality, performance, capabilities, and the like except as are expressly authorized in writing by Tripath (such as in Tripath's standard, published specifications for a Product). 4. Other Product Lines 4.1 In appointing Distributor, Tripath is relying to a significant extent on Distributor's undertaking in Subsection 2.2. 4.2 Distributor will not carry any competitive products without Tripath's consent, which shall not be unreasonable. 5. Tripath Direct Sales Activity 5.1 Tripath may in its sole discretion, immediately upon written notice to Distributor, make direct sales to certain accounts in the Territory (\"Direct Sales Accounts\"), including accounts to which Distributor has made sales. 6. Pricing, credits, and allowances 6.1 Prices for Products will be as set forth in the then effective distributor price list (\"Distributor Price List\") which will be furnished to Distributor from time to time. Any suggested resale prices shown in the Distributor Price List are to be considered as guidelines only. 6.2 The Distributor Price List may be changed without prior notice, and will be effective as of the effective date indicated. The amount and timing of such change will be exclusively at Tripath's discretion. 6.3 Orders for Products received and acknowledged by Tripath prior to a change in the Price List but shipped after the effective date of such change will be invoiced as follows: (a) in the case of a price decrease, the existing order backlog will be invoiced at the lower price, and (b) in the case of a price increase, the existing order backlog due for delivery within one month of the effective date of such change will be invoiced at the lower price. Outstanding written quotations will be held good for the same two-month period. 6.4 Distributor's inventory of any Product will be price protected for reductions in the price of such Product as follows: the lesser of Distributor's (a) entire inventory of the Product, or (b) previous one month's shipments of the Product from Tripath. 7. Purchase Orders and Payment 7.1 Distributor will maintain sufficient inventory of Products (but not less than one month's inventory without Tripath's approval) to provide prompt delivery to Distributor's customers, in furtherance of Distributor's undertaking in Subsection 2.2. -2- Distributor Agreement 7.2 Distributor will purchase Products for resale to its customers in accordance with Tripath's then effective terms and conditions of sale set forth in the Tripath sales order acknowledgment (\"Sales Order Acknowledgment\"), and the pricing terms of the then effective Distributor Price List (including minimum order quantities). The terms and conditions of sale in the Sales Order Acknowledgment may be changed without prior notice, exclusively at Tripath's discretion. 7.3 No purchase order from Distributor is binding on Tripath until Tripath issues a Sales Order Acknowledgment to Distributor for such order, or makes a shipment against such order. Tripath will use commercially reasonable efforts to acknowledge Distributor purchase orders promptly. 7.4 Tripath will invoice Distributor for Products when Tripath ships such Products. 7.5 All credits will be handled as separate financial transactions from the original invoice, and will be evidenced by a written credit request submitted to Tripath. Distributor will not reduce any payment to Tripath to account for anticipated or unauthorized credits (except for short shipments and non-receipt of Products), either at the time of the payment of original invoice, or at the time of providing a credit request. Credit requests should be submitted by Distributor within one month after the date of Distributor's invoice for the related transactions. 7.6 Any credit request will be based on the price shown on the then current Distributor Price List, or the actual net price paid by Distributor for the Product, whichever is lower. 7.7 If Tripath notifies Distributor of any discrepancy in a credit request, Distributor has one month to resolve the discrepancy and pay the amount of the discrepancy. 7.8 No purchase orders for which a Sales Order Acknowledgment has been issued may be canceled or rescheduled within one month of the scheduled shipment date without Tripath's approval. 8. Special Pricing and Other Allowances 8.1 The provisions of this Section 8 will be applicable only to transactions on DPA (distributor price authorization) basis in which Distributor first obtains a DPA confirmation from Tripath. 8.2 Requests for special pricing and/or allowances will be submitted by Distributor to the appropriate Tripath sales office, and must be first approved in writing by that office. 8.3 Quotes for special pricing are good for one month, and must be backed by a Tripath quote number. Distributor will supply supporting documentation showing Products listed by part number, date of transaction, end customer name and address, and the appropriate special pricing details, not later than two weeks after shipment to the associated customer. 8.4 If Tripath has granted Distributor special pricing on a sale in which Distributor's customer has later returned the Product to Distributor, Distributor will reimburse Tripath for the amount of the DPA allowance within one month after such return. 8.5 Any debit memo submitted by Distributor for a DPA allowance will be based on the price shown on the then current Distributor Price List, or the actual net price paid by Distributor for the Product, whichever is lower. 9. Returns 9.1 Distributor may return Products only after receiving written authorization from Tripath. All authorized returns will be shipped by Distributor freight prepaid. Unauthorized returns may be reshipped to Distributor, freight collect. -3- Distributor Agreement 9.2 Distributor may request stock rotation return of slow moving Products, which will be authorized by Tripath provided that: (a) the Product is contained in Tripath's then current Distributor Price List, (b) the Product is packaged as it was originally shipped, and (c) a purchase order for equal value accompanies the request for return. Such stock rotation returns will not exceed five percent (5%) of the dollar value of Distributor's previous six (6) months net purchase orders from Tripath. 9.3 Discontinued Product may be returned only with prior written authorization. 9.4 Credit will be allowed for returned Products based on the price actually paid by Distributor, less any prior DPAs, credits and other allowances. 9.5 If, in the reasonable opinion of Tripath, previously authorized returned Products have been used or damaged, a credit or replacement may be refused. Distributor will be notified within one month after receipt of Product by Tripath of any such Product Tripath is claiming to be used or damaged. 10. Limited Warranty 10.1 Tripath provides an end user limited warranty for retail Products, and one-year limited warranty for OEM products. The terms of the end user limited warranty are set forth in documentation provided with the retail Product. 10.2 For OEM Products, Tripath warrants that the Products will be free of manufacturing and workmanship defects for one year from the date of shipment by Distributor to a customer, or eighteen months from the date of shipment to Distributor, whichever is sooner. 10.3 If any OEM Products prove defective during this one year period as set forth in Section 10.2, Tripath will, at its option, either (a) repair or replace the Product with a new or reconditioned Product, (b) use reasonable efforts to provide Distributor with a correction of the defect, or (c) refund to Distributor the purchase price paid for the Product. Any Product replaced will become Tripath property. 10.4 Distributor must return the defective OEM Product pursuant to a return material authorization under Section 9.1 in the original shipping carton (or an equivalent protective carton), and pay the shipping and insurance charges. Distributor assumes the risk of loss or damage during shipment. 10.5 OEM Products that are defective as set forth in Section 10.2 as a result of improper handling, incorrect installation or other misuse, or as a result of accident, disaster, acts of God or other such events, as determined by Tripath in its reasonable discretion, are not covered by this limited warranty. 10.6 For OEM Products, Tripath provides only the warranties set forth in this limited one year limited warranty. For retail Products, Tripath provides to the end user only the warranties set forth in the applicable end user warranty. Any and all other warranties, either express, implied or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties of fitness for a particular purpose, or of merchantability, are hereby expressly excluded and disclaimed by Tripath. 11. Reports and Audits 11.1 Distributor will submit reports as may be reasonably requested by Tripath, including, without limitation, monthly reports of inventory on hand and sales relating to the Products. Sales data will include, without limitation, Product part number, quantity, resale price, special pricing, distributor invoice number, and customer name. Distributor will submit these reports electronically on a timely basis each month and in no case later than two weeks after the beginning of the month. -4- Distributor Agreement 11.2 Tripath may have an authorized Tripath representative, at Tripath's cost, audit Distributor's records relating to sales and inventories of Products, including, without limitation, records pertaining to any claims submitted by Distributor for price protection, stock rotation, returned Products, ship from stock and debit, DPA allowances, and credit requests. Upon prior written notice, Distributor will provide reasonable access to such records during normal business hours at Distributor's office. Distributor agrees to maintain all such records for a minimum of three years. 12. Distributor's Financial Condition 12.1 Tripath may withhold shipments because of Distributor's general financial condition and/or conditions of Distributor's account with Tripath. Such withholding will be not construed as a breach of this Agreement. 12.2 Distributor will supply Tripath with credit data sufficient to establish Distributor's credit worthiness. 13. Advertising and Sales Promotion 13.1 Distributor's tradename may be used by Tripath in its advertisements, provided that such use is in proper form. 13.2 Distributor will be eligible to participate in Tripath distributor cooperative advertising programs designated by Tripath for the Territory. However, prior approval must be obtained in writing from Tripath before any expenditures of funds by Distributor are eligible for reimbursement. 14. Tripath Trademarks 14.1 Tripath grants to Distributor a non-exclusive license to use Tripath's trademarks, trade names and service marks only in connection with the Products and in the performance of Distributor's obligations under this Agreement. All such uses are subject to Tripath's prior review and consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 14.2 All use of Tripath trademarks and service marks will be in proper form, giving appropriate attribution to Tripath as the owner of the mark. Distributor will not undertake any use of a mark in a manner that might jeopardize Tripath's rights to use or register such mark, or Tripath's rights to prevent unauthorized use. Distributor will promptly notify Tripath of any acts of unfair competition or trade or service mark infringement, and reasonably cooperate with efforts to protect Tripath's rights. 14.3 All use of Tripath trade marks and service marks by Distributor will inure to the benefit of Tripath, and Distributor will reasonably cooperate, at Tripath's expense with Tripath's efforts to register or otherwise secure rights in such marks. Upon termination of this Agreement, Distributor will immediately cease all further use of Tripath's trademarks, trade names or service marks except as may be required in the sale of Products in inventory. 15. Relationship Between the Parties 15.1 Both Distributor and Tripath are independent contractors, and no agency or other joint relationship is created. 15.2 Neither party has any authority to act for and/or to bind the other in any way, or to represent that either is in any way responsible for the acts of the other. 16. Confidentiality 16.1 Confidential information (\"Information\") of Tripath and/or Distributor will mean information that the disclosing party desires to protect against unauthorized use or disclosure, and which is furnished under this Agreement as follows: (a) written or other tangible information clearly marked with a notice, such as -5- Distributor Agreement \"CONFIDENTIAL\"; and (b) oral information that is identified at the time of disclosure as being confidential. Confidential Information will not include information that: (a) enters the public domain without a breach of this Agreement, (b) is known to the recipient prior to the time of disclosure, or is independently developed by the recipient without using any Information, or (c) is obtained from another source that the receiving party has no reasonable cause to believe is under any obligation of confidentiality with respect to Information. 16.2 The recipient of Information will treat it as proprietary and confidential, safeguarding the Information at least as carefully as it would its own confidential information, and will use all reasonable efforts to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure, including restricting access to the Information within its organization and ensuring that its employees comply with this Agreement. A receiving party will not disclose any information to any third party without prior written consent. Either party learning of any unauthorized use or disclosure of any Information will promptly notify the other party, and will reasonably cooperate with efforts to protect such Information. 16.3 The recipient of information will use it only in the furtherance of the business relationship established by this Agreement, and for no other purpose without prior written consent. All Information will remain the property of the disclosing party, and will be returned or destroyed upon written request. 16.4 The confidentiality obligations in this Agreement will be binding during the Agreement and for a period of three years after any termination or non-renewal of the Agreement. 16.5 Neither party will disclose the existence or terms of this Agreement without prior written consent. 17. Export Control 17.1 Distributor will not engage in exporting activities within the Territory without the prior written approval of Tripath, and the United States Government if such approval is necessary. Nothing in this Subsection is meant to authorize Distributor shipments outside the Territory. 17.2 Distributor understands that the Products and Tripath confidential information are restricted by the United States Government from export to certain countries, and Distributor agrees that it will not sell or license Products or transfer Tripath confidential information in any way will violate any of the export control laws or regulations of the United States. 18.

Tripath will honor all orders acknowledged prior to the effective date of any such termination by nonrenewable. 18.2 Tripath or Distributor may terminate this Agreement for any reason with thirty days written notice. 18.3 Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately if the other party becomes insolvent, or takes any steps to make an arrangement with its creditors, or has a receiver appointed. 18.4 If Tripath terminates pursuant to Subsection 18.1 or 18.2, or if Distributor terminates pursuant to Subsection 18.3, Tripath will purchase and Distributor will resell to Tripath Distributor's inventory of Products (excluding -6- Distributor Agreement discontinued and demonstration Products) which Tripath determines to be undamaged and in good condition (including, at Tripath's option on-site inspection). The price for such inventory will be the price actually paid by the Distributor, less any prior credit or allowances. 18.5 If Distributor terminates pursuant to Subsection 18.1 or 18.2, or if Tripath terminates pursuant to Subsection 18.3, Tripath may, at its option, purchase and Distributor will resell to Tripath all or part of Distributor's inventory at the price set forth in Subsection 18.4, less a ten percent restocking charge. 18.6 On termination of this Agreement for whatever cause, Distributor will immediately (a) cease to engage in marketing and distribution activities as Tripath's official distributor, and (b) cease representing in any manner that it is a distributor of Tripath Products in the Territory. 18.7 All obligations of Distributor to make payments under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement for whatever cause, along with the following provisions: Section 10 (Limited Warranty), Section 11 (Reports and Audits), Section 16 (Confidentiality), Section 17 (Export Control), Section 19 (Intellectual Property Indemnity), and Subsection 21.6 (Governing Law), and Subsection 21.7 (Arbitration). 19.

Tripath will have sole control of any such action or settlement negotiations (Tripath will not be liable for any costs or expenses incurred without its prior written authorization), and Tripath will pay any final judgment entered against Distributor or its customer based on such infringement. Tripath at its sole option will be relieved of the foregoing obligations unless Distributor or its customer notifies Tripath promptly in writing of such action and gives Tripath full information and assistance to settle and/or defend any such action. If it is adjudicated that a Product infringes, or if the sale or use of a Product is, as a result, enjoined, then Tripath will, at its option and expense either: (i) procure for Distributor and its customers the right to sell or use the Product; or (ii) replace the Product with other suitable Product; or (iii) suitably modify the Product to be noninfringing; or (iv) if none of the foregoing are commercially reasonable, as determined by Tripath, accept return of the affected Products and refund Distributor's aggregate payments for such Products, less a reasonable sum for use and/or damage, if any. 19.2 Limitation. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 19.1, Tripath assumes no liability for, and Distributor agrees to indemnify Tripath to the same extent as Tripath's indemnity under Section 19.1 for: (i) any infringements covering completed equipment or any assembly, circuit, combination, or method in which any of the Products may be used but not covering such Products standing alone; or (ii) any trademark infringements involving any marking or branding not applied by Tripath or involving any marking or branding applied at the request of Distributor; or (iii) any modification of the Products unless such modification was made by Tripath. 19.3 Entire Liability. The foregoing provisions of this section 19 state the entire liability and obligations of Tripath and the exclusive remedy of Distributor and its customers, with respect to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement by the Products. 20. Limitation of Liability 20.1 Neither Tripath nor Distributor will be liable for any incidental or consequential -7- Distributor Agreement damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or other pecuniary loss) arising out of this Agreement, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. 21. General 21.1 Assignment. This Agreement is not assignable by Distributor without prior written consent of Tripath, which will not be unreasonably withheld. Tripath is free to assign this contract without Distributor's consent. 21.2 Modifications. This Agreement may be modified only in writing signed by an officer of each party. 21.3 Headings.

This Agreement will be governed by the laws of California, without reference to conflicts of laws. 21.7 Arbitration. Any dispute or claim arising out of this Agreement will be referred to and resolved by the International Chamber of Commerce (\"ICC\") in accordance with the ICC Arbitration Rules.

       "      <td>Exhibit (8)(k)(k) SERVICE AGREEMENT This Agreement is entered into and effective as of the 1st day of January, 1998, by and between FIDELITY INVESTMENTS INSTITUTIONAL OPERATIONS COMPANY, INC. (\"FIIOC\") and NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY CORPORATION (\"Company\"). WHEREAS, FIIOC provides transfer agency and other services to Fidelity's Variable Insurance Products Fund, Variable Insurance Products Fund II and Variable Insurance Products Fund III (collectively \"Funds\"); and WHEREAS, the services provided by FIIOC on behalf of the Funds include responding to inquiries about the Funds including the provision of information about the Funds' investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, etc.; and WHEREAS, Company holds shares of the Funds in order to fund certain variable annuity contracts, group annuity contracts, and/or variable life insurance policies, the beneficial interests in which are held by individuals, plan trustees, or others who look to Company to provide information about the Funds similar to the information provided by FIIOC; and WHEREAS, the Company and one or more of the Funds have entered into one or more Participation Agreements, under which the Company agrees not to provide information about the Funds except for information provided by the Funds or their designees; and WHEREAS, FIIOC and Company desire that Company be able to respond to inquiries about the Funds from individual variable annuity owners, participants in group annuity contracts issued by the Company, and owners and participants under variable life insurance policies issued by the Company, and prospective customers for any of the above; and WHEREAS, FIIOC and Company recognize that Company's efforts in responding to customer inquiries will reduce the burden that such inquiries would place on FIIOC should such inquiries be directed to FIIOC. NOW, THEREFORE, the parties do agree as follows: 1. Information to be Provided to Company. FIIOC agrees to provide to Company, on a periodic basis, directly or through a designee, information about the Funds' investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, performance, etc. The content and format of such information shall be as FIIOC, in its sole discretion, shall choose. FIIOC may change the format and/or content of such informational reports, and the frequency with which such information is provided. For purposes of Section 4.2 of each of the Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, FIIOC represents that it is the designee of the Funds, and Company may therefore use the information provided by FIIOC without seeking additional permission from the Funds. 2. Use of Information by Company. Company may use the information provided by FIIOC in communications to individuals, plan trustees, or others who have legal title or beneficial interest in the annuity or life insurance products issued by Company, or representatives of any of these parties, and to prospective purchasers of such products or beneficial interests thereunder. If such information is contained as part of larger pieces of sales literature, advertising, etc., such pieces shall be furnished for review to the Funds in accordance with the terms of the Company's Participation Agreements with the Funds. Nothing herein shall give the Company the right to expand upon, alter the appearance of, or otherwise alter the information provided by FIIOC. Company acknowledges that the information provided it by FIIOC may need to be supplemented with additional qualifying information, regulatory disclaimers, or other information before it may be conveyed to persons outside the Company. 3. Compensation to Company. In recognition of the fact that Company will respond to inquiries that otherwise would be handled by FIIOC, FIIOC agrees to pay Company a quarterly fee computed as follows: At the close of each calendar quarter, FIIOC will determine the Average Daily Assets held in the Funds by the Company. Average Daily Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter divided by the number of calendar days in the quarter. The Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that sum shall be divided by four. The resulting number shall be the quarterly fee for that quarter, which shall be paid to Company during the following month. Should any Participation Agreement(s) between Company and any Fund(s) be terminated effective before the last day of a quarter, Company shall be entitled to a fee for that portion of the quarter during which the Participation Agreement was still in effect, unless such termination is due to misconduct on the part of the Company. For such a stub quarter, Average Daily Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter through and including the date of termination of the Participation Agreement(s), divided by the number of calendar days in that quarter for which the Participation Agreement was in effect. Such Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that number shall be multiplied by the number of days in such quarter that the Participation Agreement was in effect, then divided by three hundred sixty-five. The resulting number shall be the quarterly fee for the stub quarter, which shall be paid to Company during the following month. Notwithstanding the foregoing, compensation for each calendar quarter will not exceed [ ]. 4. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by Company at any time upon written notice to FIIOC. FIIOC may terminate this Agreement at any time upon ninety (90) days' written notice to Company. FIIOC may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to Company (1) if required by any applicable law or regulation, (2) if so required by action of the Fund(s) Board of Trustees, or (3) if Company engages in any material breach of this Agreement. This Agreement shall terminate immediately and automatically upon the termination of Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, and in such event no notice need be given hereunder. 5. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be construed and the provisions hereof interpreted under and in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 6. Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned without the written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, except that it shall be assigned automatically to any successor to FIIOC as the Funds' transfer agent, and any such successor shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have set their hands as of the date first written above. FIDELITY INVESTMENTS INSTITUTIONAL OPERATIONS COMPANY, INC.

If after          notification by the Maintenance Authorities,  the Party responsible for          such  capacity  does not take  immediate  action to prevent any further          interruption,  degradation or other negative influence, the Maintenance          Authorities  may  take any  reasonable  action  to  protect  the  other          capacity  in  TAT-14  including  the   disconnection  of  the  capacity          responsible for such interruption, degradation or adverse effect. 10.      EQUIPAGE          Unless otherwise  decided by the Managing Group,  TAT-14 shall be fully          equipped for 640 Gb/s to the System Interface level at the RFPA Date. 11       INCREASE OR DECREASE OF DESIGN CAPACITY 11.1     The  Managing  Group  may  decide  to  increase  the  Design  Capacity.          Following  such  a  decision,  the  Managing  Group  shall  develop  an          implementation  plan  for  and  the  terms  and  conditions  of such an          increase.  The proposed  implementation  plan and terms and  conditions          shall be submitted to the General Committee for approval. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 2, 1998                                                        Page 15 11.2     If  subsequent  to the RFCS Date,  the  Design  Capacity  is  decreased          pursuant to the  agreement of the Managing  Group and such  decrease of          the Design Capacity affects neither the routing of circuits assigned in          TAT-14  nor the Sold  Capacity  of  TAT-14,  the  reduction  in  Design          Capacity will be subtracted  from the CRC as determined by the Managing          Group. 11.3     In the event that the capacity which TAT-14, or any Segment thereof, is          capable of providing is reduced below the capacity  required to support          the Sold  Capacity on its  existing or planned  routings as a result of          physical deterioration,  or for other reasons beyond the control of the          Parties,  the  Managing  Group shall  initiate a review of the capacity          routings in order to support the  rerouting of such Sold  Capacity.  If          necessary,  the Managing Group may further consider changes to capacity          assignments. 11.4     Financial  adjustments  shall be made among the Parties,  as necessary,          under  terms  and  conditions  recommended  by the  Managing  Group and          approved by the General Committee. 12       OWNERSHIP PRICING 12.1     The TAT-14 Initial Ownership Pricing Matrix is shown in Annex 8. 12.2     In the event that the final  cost of TAT-14 is lower  than the  initial          budget, each Party's investment shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis in          accordance  with Schedule B, with no change to its Allocated  Capacity.          If the final  cost of TAT-14 is higher  than the  initial  budget  each          Party's investment shall be increased on a pro-rata basis in accordance          with Schedule B. Schedule C shall not be affected. 13       DEFINITION OF CAPITAL COSTS OF SEGMENT S 13.1     Capital costs of Segment S, as used in this Agreement,  refers to costs          incurred in  engineering,  providing,  and  constructing  Segment S, or          causing it to be engineered, provided, and constructed, or in laying or          causing  to be  laid  cables,  amplifiers  and  joint  housings,  or in          installing or causing to be installed cable system equipment, and shall          include:          (i)    the  costs  incurred  under  the  terms  of  the  TAT-14  MOU as                 identified in the TAT-14 budget;          (ii)   those costs payable to the Supplier  under the Supply  Contract,                 and - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 2, 1998                                                        Page 16          (iii)  other costs incurred under the direction of the Managing  Group,                 or the  Procurement  Group,  and those  capital  costs  directly                 incurred by the Terminal  Parties,  the CBP, the NA or any Party                 authorized  by the  Managing  Group,  which  shall  be fair  and                 reasonable in amount and not included in the Supply Contract and                 which have been directly and reasonably incurred for the purpose                 of,  or  to  be   properly   chargeable,   in  respect  of  such                 engineering, provision, construction, installation and laying of                 Segment S of  TAT-14.

Such  costs  shall  include  costs                 incurred by the Parties in the holding of the Data Gathering and                 the General Committee  meetings but excluding  attendance by the                 Parties' representatives at such meetings. Such costs shall also                 include costs incurred by the Parties in holding the meetings of                 the Managing Group, the Procurement Group and its Working Groups                 and   the   preparation   and   attendance   by   the   Parties'                 representatives at such meetings. 13.2     Capital  costs shall  exclude  costs  incurred  by the Parties  holding          meetings  of the AR&amp;R  Subcommittee  and F&amp;A  Subcommittee  established          pursuant to Subparagraph 7.2 of this Agreement or the attendance by the          Parties' representatives at such meetings. 13.3     Any  amounts  received  by,  or  credited  to,  a Party or the CBP as a          consequence  of  letters of  guarantee,  liquidated  damages,  or other          similar  amounts  resulting  from the failure of the  Supplier to fully          perform  any  provision  of the Supply  Contract,  shall  accrue to the          benefit of all the Parties in accordance with Schedule B. 13.4     The cost of repair or replacement of any part of TAT-14 in the event of          damage or loss arising during construction, laying, burying, installing          and the bringing into operation of TAT-14,  which is attributable under          the Supply  Contract to the  Parties,  shall be regarded as part of the          capital costs for the purpose of Subparagraph  13.1. Any of the Parties          may at its own  expense  insure  against  such  risks so far as its own          share of costs is concerned. Should the Managing Group agree to jointly          insure against such risks, the cost of such insurance will form part of          the capital costs referred to in Subparagraph 13.1. 14       ALLOCATION AND BILLING OF SEGMENTS CAPITAL COSTS 14.1     The capital  costs of Segment S of TAT-14,  as defined in Paragraph 13,          including any additional  work or property  incorporated  subsequent to          the RFPA Date - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 2, 1998                                                        Page 17          by  agreement  of the  Parties,  shall be borne by the  Parties  in the          proportions set forth in Schedule B. 14.2     The CBP will receive  invoices  from the Supplier for the costs due and          included in the Supply  Contract.  The Parties  shall  promptly  render          invoices to the CBP for the cost of items directly  incurred by them in          accordance with Subparagraph  13.1. The CBP shall promptly render bills          to each of the Parties for such Party's pro rata share of costs due and          included in the invoices it has received in accordance with Schedule B.          Such bills shall contain a reasonable  amount of detail to substantiate          them.  On the basis of such bills,  each Party shall pay to the CBP the          amount  owed  within  forty-five  (45)  days from the date the bill was          rendered by the CBP in the currency shown on the respective bill. 14.3     For the purpose of this Agreement, financial charges shall be computed,          as appropriate,  at a rate equal to the lowest publicly announced prime          rate  or  minimum  commercial  lending  rate,  however  described,  for          ninety-day  loans on the 1st working day of each month of the period to          be  considered  in the Country and in the currency in which the bill is          rendered.  With respect to the Parties  rendering  invoices  under this          Agreement,  Annex 7 specifies those rates. If the Managing Group should          authorize a Party in a Country other than those Parties listed in Annex          7 to render  invoices,  the Managing Group shall specify the applicable          rates. 14.4     For the  purposes of this  Agreement,  \"paid\" shall mean that the funds          are available for immediate use by the recipient. 14.5     Bills not paid when due shall accrue extended  payment charges from the          day  following  the date on which  payment was due in  accordance  with          Subparagraph  14.2 until the day on which it is paid.  For the purposes          of this Agreement, extended payment charges shall be computed at a rate          equal to 150 % of the  appropriate  financial  charges as  indicated in          Subparagraph 14.3 on the day following the date payment of the bill was          due. In the event that applicable law allows the imposition of extended          payment  interest  charges only at a rate less than that established in          accordance with this Subparagraph, extended payment charges shall be at          the  highest  rate  permitted  by such  applicable  law.  In this case,          appropriate  documents to  demonstrate  the  applicability  of such law          shall be provided by the concerned Party. 14.6     Extended payment charges recovered by the CBP, in excess of the amounts          paid or due, excluding interest paid by whichever Party or Parties have          covered  the deficit in the  intervening  period,  shall  accrue to the          benefit of all the Parties in accordance with Schedule B. 14.7     Procedures for rendering  credits for refunds of appropriate  financial          charges and bills for extended payment charges will be developed by the          CBP in conjunction with the F&amp;A Subcommittee. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 2, 1998                                                        Page 18 14.8     As soon as practicable  after the RFPA Date, the amount of each Party's          share of the costs of Segment S shall be computed by the CBP which will          make appropriate  adjustments and render any necessary bills or arrange          for any necessary refunds by way of final settlement in order that each          Party  may  bear its  appropriate  share of the  costs as  provided  in          Subparagraph 14.1. 14.9     A bill shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Party to whom it is          rendered if that Party does not present a written  objection to the CBP          on or before  fifteen  (15) days prior to the date when payment is due.          If such  objection  is made,  the  Parties  concerned  shall make every          reasonable effort to settle promptly the dispute concerning the bill in          question.  If the  objection is sustained and the billed Party has paid          the  disputed  bill,  the agreed  upon  overpayment  shall be  refunded          promptly to the objecting  Party by the billing Party together with any          financial charges calculated thereon at a rate determined in accordance          with  Subparagraph  14.3 of this  Agreement from the date of payment of          the  bill  to the  date on  which  the  refund  is  transmitted  to the          objecting Party. If the objection is not sustained and the billed Party          has not paid the disputed bill,  said Party will pay such bill promptly          together with any extended payment charges calculated thereon at a rate          determined in accordance with  Subparagraph 14.5 of this Agreement from          the day  following  the date on which payment of the bill was due until          paid.  Nothing in this  Subparagraph  shall relieve a Party from paying          those parts of a bill that are not in dispute.  The  provisions of this          Subparagraph  shall be  without  prejudice  to the  rights of any Party          pursuant to Paragraph 21 of this Agreement. 15       TRANSIT FACILITIES TO EXTEND TAT-14 CAPACITY AND CONNECTION WITH INLAND          SYSTEMS 15.1     The Terminal  Parties shall use all  reasonable  efforts to furnish and          maintain, or cause to be furnished and maintained, in working order for          the other Parties and for the Purchasers in TAT-14, for the duration of          this Agreement,  the necessary facilities in their respective Countries          as may be reasonably required for extending capacity in TAT-14 assigned          to  such   Parties  or   Purchasers   for  the   purpose  of   handling          communications  transiting  the  Country  involved.

(\"Tripath\"), and Uniquest Corporation 780 Montague Expressway Suite 406 Santa Jose, CA 95131 Tripath and Distributor intend to establish Distributor as a non-exclusive Distributor for Tripath products in the following designated Territory, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Korea 1. Products 1.1 \"Products\" means the Tripath semiconductor products identified by Tripath in writing from time to time. 1.2 Tripath may discontinue manufacture or sale, or otherwise treat as obsolete, any or all of the Products covered by this Agreement upon thirty days written notice. 2. Appointment and Term 2.1 For the term of this Agreement, Tripath appoints Distributor as a non-exclusive distributor for the Products in the Territory, subject to Tripath's direct sales activities under Section 4. 2.2 Distributor will use best efforts to develop the local market and promote the sales of Products within the Territory. Distributor will not sell outside the Territory without Tripath's prior written permission, which will not be unreasonably withheld. 2.3 After one month's written notice, Tripath may in its discretion amend (i) the Products, and/or (ii) the Territory. 2.4 Tripath reserves the right to appoint other distributors in or out of the Territory who may sell into the Territory. 2.5 Distributor's appointment is for a term of one year from the Effective Date, renewable automatically unless terminated under Section 18 3. Distributor Responsibilities 3.1 Distributor will maintain an adequately trained sales organization, capable of fulfilling its obligation under Subsection 2.2. 3.2 Tripath will furnish technical and marketing information (such as sales aids and Distributor Agreement literature, data sheets, application notes, etc.) for the Products, and Distributor will maintain an organized and well stocked collection of such technical and marketing information for distribution to prospective customers. 3.3 Distributor will employ sufficient trained personnel (\"Application Engineers\") to provide technical and marketing support for Tripath's Products. Distributor and Tripath will cooperate to ensure that the Application Engineers are and remain adequately trained and qualified. 3.4 Distributor will maintain a reasonable number of Demonstration Products (customer samples), with appropriate technical and marketing literature, available for demonstration by knowledgeable Distributor personnel, provided that Distributor must obtain prior approval by Tripath before any customer receives demonstration Products (customer samples). 3.5 Distributor has no authorization to make, and will not make, any guarantee or warranty with respect to any Product — all Product warranties are to be communicated to Customers directly by Tripath in writing. Distributor will make no representations as to quality, performance, capabilities, and the like except as are expressly authorized in writing by Tripath (such as in Tripath's standard, published specifications for a Product). 4. Other Product Lines 4.1 In appointing Distributor, Tripath is relying to a significant extent on Distributor's undertaking in Subsection 2.2. 4.2 Distributor will not carry any competitive products without Tripath's consent, which shall not be unreasonable. 5. Tripath Direct Sales Activity 5.1 Tripath may in its sole discretion, immediately upon written notice to Distributor, make direct sales to certain accounts in the Territory (\"Direct Sales Accounts\"), including accounts to which Distributor has made sales. 6. Pricing, credits, and allowances 6.1 Prices for Products will be as set forth in the then effective distributor price list (\"Distributor Price List\") which will be furnished to Distributor from time to time. Any suggested resale prices shown in the Distributor Price List are to be considered as guidelines only. 6.2 The Distributor Price List may be changed without prior notice, and will be effective as of the effective date indicated. The amount and timing of such change will be exclusively at Tripath's discretion. 6.3 Orders for Products received and acknowledged by Tripath prior to a change in the Price List but shipped after the effective date of such change will be invoiced as follows: (a) in the case of a price decrease, the existing order backlog will be invoiced at the lower price, and (b) in the case of a price increase, the existing order backlog due for delivery within one month of the effective date of such change will be invoiced at the lower price. Outstanding written quotations will be held good for the same two-month period. 6.4 Distributor's inventory of any Product will be price protected for reductions in the price of such Product as follows: the lesser of Distributor's (a) entire inventory of the Product, or (b) previous one month's shipments of the Product from Tripath. 7. Purchase Orders and Payment 7.1 Distributor will maintain sufficient inventory of Products (but not less than one month's inventory without Tripath's approval) to provide prompt delivery to Distributor's customers, in furtherance of Distributor's undertaking in Subsection 2.2. -2- Distributor Agreement 7.2 Distributor will purchase Products for resale to its customers in accordance with Tripath's then effective terms and conditions of sale set forth in the Tripath sales order acknowledgment (\"Sales Order Acknowledgment\"), and the pricing terms of the then effective Distributor Price List (including minimum order quantities). The terms and conditions of sale in the Sales Order Acknowledgment may be changed without prior notice, exclusively at Tripath's discretion. 7.3 No purchase order from Distributor is binding on Tripath until Tripath issues a Sales Order Acknowledgment to Distributor for such order, or makes a shipment against such order. Tripath will use commercially reasonable efforts to acknowledge Distributor purchase orders promptly. 7.4 Tripath will invoice Distributor for Products when Tripath ships such Products. 7.5 All credits will be handled as separate financial transactions from the original invoice, and will be evidenced by a written credit request submitted to Tripath. Distributor will not reduce any payment to Tripath to account for anticipated or unauthorized credits (except for short shipments and non-receipt of Products), either at the time of the payment of original invoice, or at the time of providing a credit request. Credit requests should be submitted by Distributor within one month after the date of Distributor's invoice for the related transactions. 7.6 Any credit request will be based on the price shown on the then current Distributor Price List, or the actual net price paid by Distributor for the Product, whichever is lower. 7.7 If Tripath notifies Distributor of any discrepancy in a credit request, Distributor has one month to resolve the discrepancy and pay the amount of the discrepancy. 7.8 No purchase orders for which a Sales Order Acknowledgment has been issued may be canceled or rescheduled within one month of the scheduled shipment date without Tripath's approval. 8. Special Pricing and Other Allowances 8.1 The provisions of this Section 8 will be applicable only to transactions on DPA (distributor price authorization) basis in which Distributor first obtains a DPA confirmation from Tripath. 8.2 Requests for special pricing and/or allowances will be submitted by Distributor to the appropriate Tripath sales office, and must be first approved in writing by that office. 8.3 Quotes for special pricing are good for one month, and must be backed by a Tripath quote number. Distributor will supply supporting documentation showing Products listed by part number, date of transaction, end customer name and address, and the appropriate special pricing details, not later than two weeks after shipment to the associated customer. 8.4 If Tripath has granted Distributor special pricing on a sale in which Distributor's customer has later returned the Product to Distributor, Distributor will reimburse Tripath for the amount of the DPA allowance within one month after such return. 8.5 Any debit memo submitted by Distributor for a DPA allowance will be based on the price shown on the then current Distributor Price List, or the actual net price paid by Distributor for the Product, whichever is lower. 9. Returns 9.1 Distributor may return Products only after receiving written authorization from Tripath. All authorized returns will be shipped by Distributor freight prepaid. Unauthorized returns may be reshipped to Distributor, freight collect. -3- Distributor Agreement 9.2 Distributor may request stock rotation return of slow moving Products, which will be authorized by Tripath provided that: (a) the Product is contained in Tripath's then current Distributor Price List, (b) the Product is packaged as it was originally shipped, and (c) a purchase order for equal value accompanies the request for return. Such stock rotation returns will not exceed five percent (5%) of the dollar value of Distributor's previous six (6) months net purchase orders from Tripath. 9.3 Discontinued Product may be returned only with prior written authorization. 9.4 Credit will be allowed for returned Products based on the price actually paid by Distributor, less any prior DPAs, credits and other allowances. 9.5 If, in the reasonable opinion of Tripath, previously authorized returned Products have been used or damaged, a credit or replacement may be refused. Distributor will be notified within one month after receipt of Product by Tripath of any such Product Tripath is claiming to be used or damaged. 10. Limited Warranty 10.1 Tripath provides an end user limited warranty for retail Products, and one-year limited warranty for OEM products. The terms of the end user limited warranty are set forth in documentation provided with the retail Product. 10.2 For OEM Products, Tripath warrants that the Products will be free of manufacturing and workmanship defects for one year from the date of shipment by Distributor to a customer, or eighteen months from the date of shipment to Distributor, whichever is sooner. 10.3 If any OEM Products prove defective during this one year period as set forth in Section 10.2, Tripath will, at its option, either (a) repair or replace the Product with a new or reconditioned Product, (b) use reasonable efforts to provide Distributor with a correction of the defect, or (c) refund to Distributor the purchase price paid for the Product. Any Product replaced will become Tripath property. 10.4 Distributor must return the defective OEM Product pursuant to a return material authorization under Section 9.1 in the original shipping carton (or an equivalent protective carton), and pay the shipping and insurance charges. Distributor assumes the risk of loss or damage during shipment. 10.5 OEM Products that are defective as set forth in Section 10.2 as a result of improper handling, incorrect installation or other misuse, or as a result of accident, disaster, acts of God or other such events, as determined by Tripath in its reasonable discretion, are not covered by this limited warranty. 10.6 For OEM Products, Tripath provides only the warranties set forth in this limited one year limited warranty. For retail Products, Tripath provides to the end user only the warranties set forth in the applicable end user warranty. Any and all other warranties, either express, implied or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties of fitness for a particular purpose, or of merchantability, are hereby expressly excluded and disclaimed by Tripath. 11. Reports and Audits 11.1 Distributor will submit reports as may be reasonably requested by Tripath, including, without limitation, monthly reports of inventory on hand and sales relating to the Products. Sales data will include, without limitation, Product part number, quantity, resale price, special pricing, distributor invoice number, and customer name.

Upon prior written notice, Distributor will provide reasonable access to such records during normal business hours at Distributor's office. Distributor agrees to maintain all such records for a minimum of three years. 12.

Tripath at its sole option will be relieved of the foregoing obligations unless Distributor or its customer notifies Tripath promptly in writing of such action and gives Tripath full information and assistance to settle and/or defend any such action.

       "      <td>Exhibit (8)(k)(k) SERVICE AGREEMENT This Agreement is entered into and effective as of the 1st day of January, 1998, by and between FIDELITY INVESTMENTS INSTITUTIONAL OPERATIONS COMPANY, INC. (\"FIIOC\") and NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY CORPORATION (\"Company\"). WHEREAS, FIIOC provides transfer agency and other services to Fidelity's Variable Insurance Products Fund, Variable Insurance Products Fund II and Variable Insurance Products Fund III (collectively \"Funds\"); and WHEREAS, the services provided by FIIOC on behalf of the Funds include responding to inquiries about the Funds including the provision of information about the Funds' investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, etc.; and WHEREAS, Company holds shares of the Funds in order to fund certain variable annuity contracts, group annuity contracts, and/or variable life insurance policies, the beneficial interests in which are held by individuals, plan trustees, or others who look to Company to provide information about the Funds similar to the information provided by FIIOC; and WHEREAS, the Company and one or more of the Funds have entered into one or more Participation Agreements, under which the Company agrees not to provide information about the Funds except for information provided by the Funds or their designees; and WHEREAS, FIIOC and Company desire that Company be able to respond to inquiries about the Funds from individual variable annuity owners, participants in group annuity contracts issued by the Company, and owners and participants under variable life insurance policies issued by the Company, and prospective customers for any of the above; and WHEREAS, FIIOC and Company recognize that Company's efforts in responding to customer inquiries will reduce the burden that such inquiries would place on FIIOC should such inquiries be directed to FIIOC. NOW, THEREFORE, the parties do agree as follows: 1. Information to be Provided to Company. FIIOC agrees to provide to Company, on a periodic basis, directly or through a designee, information about the Funds' investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, performance, etc. The content and format of such information shall be as FIIOC, in its sole discretion, shall choose. FIIOC may change the format and/or content of such informational reports, and the frequency with which such information is provided. For purposes of Section 4.2 of each of the Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, FIIOC represents that it is the designee of the Funds, and Company may therefore use the information provided by FIIOC without seeking additional permission from the Funds. 2. Use of Information by Company. Company may use the information provided by FIIOC in communications to individuals, plan trustees, or others who have legal title or beneficial interest in the annuity or life insurance products issued by Company, or representatives of any of these parties, and to prospective purchasers of such products or beneficial interests thereunder. If such information is contained as part of larger pieces of sales literature, advertising, etc., such pieces shall be furnished for review to the Funds in accordance with the terms of the Company's Participation Agreements with the Funds. Nothing herein shall give the Company the right to expand upon, alter the appearance of, or otherwise alter the information provided by FIIOC. Company acknowledges that the information provided it by FIIOC may need to be supplemented with additional qualifying information, regulatory disclaimers, or other information before it may be conveyed to persons outside the Company. 3. Compensation to Company. In recognition of the fact that Company will respond to inquiries that otherwise would be handled by FIIOC, FIIOC agrees to pay Company a quarterly fee computed as follows: At the close of each calendar quarter, FIIOC will determine the Average Daily Assets held in the Funds by the Company. Average Daily Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter divided by the number of calendar days in the quarter. The Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that sum shall be divided by four. The resulting number shall be the quarterly fee for that quarter, which shall be paid to Company during the following month. Should any Participation Agreement(s) between Company and any Fund(s) be terminated effective before the last day of a quarter, Company shall be entitled to a fee for that portion of the quarter during which the Participation Agreement was still in effect, unless such termination is due to misconduct on the part of the Company. For such a stub quarter, Average Daily Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter through and including the date of termination of the Participation Agreement(s), divided by the number of calendar days in that quarter for which the Participation Agreement was in effect. Such Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that number shall be multiplied by the number of days in such quarter that the Participation Agreement was in effect, then divided by three hundred sixty-five. The resulting number shall be the quarterly fee for the stub quarter, which shall be paid to Company during the following month. Notwithstanding the foregoing, compensation for each calendar quarter will not exceed [ ]. 4. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by Company at any time upon written notice to FIIOC. FIIOC may terminate this Agreement at any time upon ninety (90) days' written notice to Company. FIIOC may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to Company (1) if required by any applicable law or regulation, (2) if so required by action of the Fund(s) Board of Trustees, or (3) if Company engages in any material breach of this Agreement. This Agreement shall terminate immediately and automatically upon the termination of Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, and in such event no notice need be given hereunder. 5. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be construed and the provisions hereof interpreted under and in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 6. Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned without the written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, except that it shall be assigned automatically to any successor to FIIOC as the Funds' transfer agent, and any such successor shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have set their hands as of the date first written above. FIDELITY INVESTMENTS INSTITUTIONAL OPERATIONS COMPANY, INC.

A Party or  Purchaser  may move any portion of its  capacity,  from one          Cable  Station,  to any other Cable  Station  without  any  increase in          investment.  A request for such a reassignment shall be notified to the          NA at some period in advance of the date of  reassignment,  such period          and  reassignment  shall be in accordance with procedures  developed by          the NA and approved by the Managing Group. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 2, 1998                                                        Paqe 13 9.5      The CRC of TAT-14 shall be owned by the Parties in common and undivided          shares. 9.6      The Managing Group shall  establish the terms and conditions  including          pricing  criteria  for  sales of  capacity  from the CRC.  The NA shall          develop  procedures  for sale of  capacity  from the CRC and a Purchase          Contract for approval by the Managing  Group.  Following such approval,          the NA shall be  authorized  to execute any such  Purchase  Contract on          behalf of all the Parties. No provisions of any Purchase Contract shall          override the provisions of this Agreement.

No  provisions  of a Private          Agreement shall override the provisions of this Agreement. 9.9      Each Purchase Contract or Private Agreement shall          (i)    contain at least the same  conditions on utilization of capacity                 as specified in Subparagraphs 9.16 and 9.17; and          (ii)   require that the entity  acquiring the capacity may only further                 transfer its capacity under the same conditions. 9.10     Notwithstanding  Subparagraph  2.3, at the  discretion  of the Managing          Group,  the  distribution of capacity from the CRC may be made on a pro          rata basis, in whole  Ring-MlUs,  in accordance with the percentages in          Schedule C. 9.11     No later than three years after the TAT-14 RFCS the remaining CRC shall          be  distributed  to the Parties on a pro rata basis in accordance  with          Schedule C. The Managing  Group will determine the process for the sale          of  capacity  of  those  Parties  that  do  not  need  their  pro  rata          distribution. 9.12     The  Managing  Group  may  authorize  the  utilization  of the  CRC for          restoration of other communications  systems based on appropriate terms          and conditions. Parties will be refunded in accordance with Schedule B. 9.13     The Managing  Group may study and  negotiate  the exchange or sale of a          portion of the CRC with other cable  systems on such basis as is deemed          mutually  beneficial to the Parties.  The terms and  conditions of such          exchange  or  sale  of  capacity  shall  be  approved  by  the  General          Committee. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 2, 1998                                                        Page 14 9.14     The  Managing  Group  may  authorize  occasional  use  of the  CRC,  if          available,    for   the    provision   of   temporary   or   occasional          telecommunications services, including but not limited to leases to any          Party or Purchaser and paid restoration of other systems,  on terms and          conditions  to be determined  by the Managing  Group.  The revenue from          such  occasional use shall be shared by the Parties in accordance  with          Schedule B 9.15     TAT-14 shall be capable of at least  supporting  payload paths of VC12,          VC3 and VC4.  The Parties  shall have the right to access such  payload          paths which shall  require 1, 21 and 63 contiguous  MIUs  respectively.          Each Party will also be permitted  to access its capacity  ownership on          defined SDH levels of its choice at a higher order in  accordance  with          the System Interface. 9.16     The  communications  capability of any capacity may be optimized by the          Parties or  Purchasers  to whom such capacity is assigned by the use of          equipment which will more efficiently use such capacity,  provided that          the use of such  equipment  does  not  cause  an  interruption  of,  or          interference  to the use of any other capacity in TAT-14 or prevent the          use  of  similar  equipment  by  other  Parties  or  Purchasers.   Such          equipment, if used, shall not constitute a part of TAT-14. 9.17     Data  streams  entering  into and being  transported  by TAT-14 must be          compliant with the ITU  Recommendation  G.707,  issue 1996, in order to          avoid any interruption,  degradation or any other adverse effect on the          performance  of TAT-14 or other  data  streams  in  TAT-14.  Each Party          agrees that all of its  capacity  will comply with this  obligation  in          respect of all  capacity  which is  assigned  to that  Party.  If after          notification by the Maintenance Authorities,  the Party responsible for          such  capacity  does not take  immediate  action to prevent any further          interruption,  degradation or other negative influence, the Maintenance          Authorities  may  take any  reasonable  action  to  protect  the  other          capacity  in  TAT-14  including  the   disconnection  of  the  capacity          responsible for such interruption, degradation or adverse effect. 10.      EQUIPAGE          Unless otherwise  decided by the Managing Group,  TAT-14 shall be fully          equipped for 640 Gb/s to the System Interface level at the RFPA Date. 11       INCREASE OR DECREASE OF DESIGN CAPACITY 11.1     The  Managing  Group  may  decide  to  increase  the  Design  Capacity.          Following  such  a  decision,  the  Managing  Group  shall  develop  an          implementation  plan  for  and  the  terms  and  conditions  of such an          increase.  The proposed  implementation  plan and terms and  conditions          shall be submitted to the General Committee for approval. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 2, 1998                                                        Page 15 11.2     If  subsequent  to the RFCS Date,  the  Design  Capacity  is  decreased          pursuant to the  agreement of the Managing  Group and such  decrease of          the Design Capacity affects neither the routing of circuits assigned in          TAT-14  nor the Sold  Capacity  of  TAT-14,  the  reduction  in  Design          Capacity will be subtracted  from the CRC as determined by the Managing          Group. 11.3     In the event that the capacity which TAT-14, or any Segment thereof, is          capable of providing is reduced below the capacity  required to support          the Sold  Capacity on its  existing or planned  routings as a result of          physical deterioration,  or for other reasons beyond the control of the          Parties,  the  Managing  Group shall  initiate a review of the capacity          routings in order to support the  rerouting of such Sold  Capacity.  If          necessary,  the Managing Group may further consider changes to capacity          assignments. 11.4     Financial  adjustments  shall be made among the Parties,  as necessary,          under  terms  and  conditions  recommended  by the  Managing  Group and          approved by the General Committee. 12       OWNERSHIP PRICING 12.1     The TAT-14 Initial Ownership Pricing Matrix is shown in Annex 8. 12.2     In the event that the final  cost of TAT-14 is lower  than the  initial          budget, each Party's investment shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis in          accordance  with Schedule B, with no change to its Allocated  Capacity.          If the final  cost of TAT-14 is higher  than the  initial  budget  each          Party's investment shall be increased on a pro-rata basis in accordance          with Schedule B.

The Parties  shall  promptly  render          invoices to the CBP for the cost of items directly  incurred by them in          accordance with Subparagraph  13.1. The CBP shall promptly render bills          to each of the Parties for such Party's pro rata share of costs due and          included in the invoices it has received in accordance with Schedule B.          Such bills shall contain a reasonable  amount of detail to substantiate          them.  On the basis of such bills,  each Party shall pay to the CBP the          amount  owed  within  forty-five  (45)  days from the date the bill was          rendered by the CBP in the currency shown on the respective bill. 14.3     For the purpose of this Agreement, financial charges shall be computed,          as appropriate,  at a rate equal to the lowest publicly announced prime          rate  or  minimum  commercial  lending  rate,  however  described,  for          ninety-day  loans on the 1st working day of each month of the period to          be  considered  in the Country and in the currency in which the bill is          rendered.  With respect to the Parties  rendering  invoices  under this          Agreement,  Annex 7 specifies those rates. If the Managing Group should          authorize a Party in a Country other than those Parties listed in Annex          7 to render  invoices,  the Managing Group shall specify the applicable          rates. 14.4     For the  purposes of this  Agreement,  \"paid\" shall mean that the funds          are available for immediate use by the recipient. 14.5     Bills not paid when due shall accrue extended  payment charges from the          day  following  the date on which  payment was due in  accordance  with          Subparagraph  14.2 until the day on which it is paid.

In the event that applicable law allows the imposition of extended          payment  interest  charges only at a rate less than that established in          accordance with this Subparagraph, extended payment charges shall be at          the  highest  rate  permitted  by such  applicable  law.  In this case,          appropriate  documents to  demonstrate  the  applicability  of such law          shall be provided by the concerned Party. 14.6     Extended payment charges recovered by the CBP, in excess of the amounts          paid or due, excluding interest paid by whichever Party or Parties have          covered  the deficit in the  intervening  period,  shall  accrue to the          benefit of all the Parties in accordance with Schedule B. 14.7     Procedures for rendering  credits for refunds of appropriate  financial          charges and bills for extended payment charges will be developed by the          CBP in conjunction with the F&amp;A Subcommittee. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- September 2, 1998                                                        Page 18 14.8     As soon as practicable  after the RFPA Date, the amount of each Party's          share of the costs of Segment S shall be computed by the CBP which will          make appropriate  adjustments and render any necessary bills or arrange          for any necessary refunds by way of final settlement in order that each          Party  may  bear its  appropriate  share of the  costs as  provided  in          Subparagraph 14.1. 14.9     A bill shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Party to whom it is          rendered if that Party does not present a written  objection to the CBP          on or before  fifteen  (15) days prior to the date when payment is due.          If such  objection  is made,  the  Parties  concerned  shall make every          reasonable effort to settle promptly the dispute concerning the bill in          question.  If the  objection is sustained and the billed Party has paid          the  disputed  bill,  the agreed  upon  overpayment  shall be  refunded          promptly to the objecting  Party by the billing Party together with any          financial charges calculated thereon at a rate determined in accordance          with  Subparagraph  14.3 of this  Agreement from the date of payment of          the  bill  to the  date on  which  the  refund  is  transmitted  to the          objecting Party. If the objection is not sustained and the billed Party          has not paid the disputed bill,  said Party will pay such bill promptly          together with any extended payment charges calculated thereon at a rate          determined in accordance with  Subparagraph 14.5 of this Agreement from          the day  following  the date on which payment of the bill was due until          paid.  Nothing in this  Subparagraph  shall relieve a Party from paying          those parts of a bill that are not in dispute.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, MediWound shall remain liable for the performance of all Third Party subcontractors and its Affiliates under this Agreement. (b) MediWound shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any Third Party Supply Agreement [***]. (c) If the forecasting or order timing or other provisions of a Third Party Supply Agreement do not align with the corresponding provisions of this Agreement then the Parties shall discuss in good faith appropriate modifications to this Agreement or to such Third Party Supply Agreement, to bring the relevant provisions into alignment; provided, however, that Vericel or MediWound shall have no obligation to agree to any amendment to this Agreement or such Third Party Supply Agreement that can reasonably be expected to materially disadvantage Vericel or MediWound, respectively. 2.6 Facilities. (a) Current and Expanded Capacity. The Parties agree and acknowledge that, as of the Effective Date, MediWound's current Facility can fill orders from Vericel for use in the Territory up to [***] of Intermediate Drug Product, whether provided in that form or in the form of the equivalent amount of Finished Product within a calendar year (\"Maximum Capacity\"). The Parties agree and acknowledge that the Facility will require either expansion or modification (which may include moving to or adding another location) to meet future capacity requirements for the Product. By no later than [***], MediWound shall fund, at its sole cost, the expansion of its annual manufacturing capacity to be [***] of Intermediate Drug Product (whether provided in that form or in the form of the equivalent amount of Finished Product). The Parties will in good faith review existing market research to mutually agree on peak anticipated volume prior to [***]. After the foregoing expansion, the expanded capacity shall be deemed the \"Maximum Capacity\" for purposes of this Agreement. As part of the expansion of the Facility, the Parties will discuss any shut down or transfer to another facility made in connection therewith. (b) Shut-Down or Expansion of Facility; Transfer to Another Facility. In the event that MediWound desires to cease or shut down operations at a Facility, expand or modify a Facility, or transfer the Manufacturing of a Product to another facility which would reasonably be anticipated to result in inability (permanent or temporary) of MediWound to Manufacture, supply or otherwise perform its obligations hereunder, MediWound shall provide prior written notice to Vericel within the applicable Change Notification Period of such planned shut-down, cessation, expansion, modification or transfer. During such Change Notification Period, Vericel 7 9012190/26 will have the right to order, and in such case MediWound will manufacture, up to [***] of quantities of Product set forth in the Rolling Forecast with respect to such Change Notification Period which in any event will not exceed the Maximum Capacity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, MediWound shall remain obligated to supply Product at the then current Facility and will not supply Product to Vericel from a new facility unless and until MediWound can perform the Manufacturing and supply Product from such new Facility in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and any modifications to the regulatory filings for such Product are approved by the relevant Regulatory Authorities. MediWound shall bear all costs incurred in connection with the shut-down, cessation, expansion or modification of the Facility or transfer of the Manufacturing of a Product to a new facility pursuant to this Section 2.6(b), including any costs associated with changes to the regulatory filings. Once such new facility is able to Manufacture in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and all required regulatory changes have been approved, such new facility shall be the Facility for purposes of such Product under this Agreement. 2.7 Establishment of Second Source. (a) Within [***] of the Effective Date, MediWound must provide Vericel with true and accurate copies of all documents consistent with Schedule 2.7. If MediWound does not provide all documents within [***] of the Effective Date, Vericel's obligation under Section 8.1 regarding the time period to provide MediWound with a notice of an extension of the Initial Term shall be extended by the amount of time beyond [***] taken by MediWound to provide the required documents. (b) Within [***] of a request by Vericel to initiate technology transfer or as soon as reasonably practicable upon request by Vericel in connection with a Supply Failure, MediWound shall provide Vericel, at Vericel's cost consistent with Schedule 4.5, with information necessary for Vericel to qualify a second or back-up supplier identified by Vericel for the Manufacture and supply of Product (a \"Second Source\") and facilitate technology transfer to such Second Source so that Vericel can consistently manufacture intermediate and final product that meets all specifications. MediWound will notify the IIA in accordance with applicable Israeli Laws upon the commencement of Manufacture of Product by such Second Source. MediWound will provide Vericel with access to the manufacturing process and information and any and all original processes, records, and any other information required to manufacture, package and test the Product in accordance with the Specifications. Second Source manufacturers shall be permitted to manufacture Product for Vericel, its Affiliates and Sublicensees as provided in Section 9.1 and the License Agreement; provided that such Second Source manufacturers: [***]. 2.8 Forecasting and Ordering. (a) Forecasting. Vericel shall furnish MediWound with a [***] rolling forecast of the quantities of each Product that Vericel intends to order during the succeeding [***] period (each, a \"Rolling Forecast\") which in any event will not exceed the Maximum Capacity for the Binding Forecast. No later than [***] after the filing of a BLA, Vericel shall 8 9012190/26 furnish MediWound the first rolling Forecast. Subject to this Section 2.8, the [***] of each Rolling Forecast shall constitute a binding order for the quantities of Product specified (\"Binding Forecast\"). The remaining [***] of each Rolling Forecast shall be non-binding, but shall represent Vericel's good faith estimate, as of the date of its submission of the Rolling Forecast, of its forecasted requirements of the Product during such period. MediWound shall maintain at all times the manufacturing capacity at the relevant Facility to manufacture [***] of the quantities of Product set forth in the current Calendar Year of the Rolling Forecast (as was set forth at the Rolling Forecast submitted immediately prior to the beginning of such Calendar Year) which in any event will not exceed the Maximum Capacity. (b) Purchase Orders. On a Calendar Quarter basis, Vericel shall issue at least one Purchase Order for the number and unit size of each Product specified in the Binding Forecast. Vericel is not limited to one Purchase Order per Calendar Quarter. Each Purchase Order shall specify (i) a purchase order number; (ii) the quantity of units of each Product to be Manufactured; and (iii) the requested delivery date of such Product (which in no event shall be earlier than [***] days following the date the applicable Purchase Order was received by MediWound). MediWound shall respond to each Purchase Order within [***] of receipt by: (i) accepting such Purchase Order if it conforms to the requirements of this Agreement or (ii) notifying Vericel if such Purchase Order does not conform to the requirements of this Agreement. If MediWound timely notifies Vericel that a Purchase Order does not conform to the requirements of this Agreement, the Parties shall confer as soon as reasonably practicable to resolve any issues related to such purported nonconformity. If MediWound fails to respond to a Purchase Order that is consistent with the Binding Forecast within [***] after receiving it, Vericel will, within [***] thereafter, confirm with MediWound that such Purchase Order was received by MediWound, and if such Purchase Order is consistent with the Binding Forecast and was properly submitted by Vericel in accordance with this Section 2.8(b), MediWound shall be deemed to have accepted such Purchase Order (\"Binding Order\") as of the date of MediWound's receipt of such Purchase Order. If a Purchase Order contains quantities of Products in excess of the quantity of such Product forecasted for such quarter (as was set forth at the Rolling Forecast submitted immediately prior to the beginning of such Calendar Year) by an amount greater than [***] of the Binding Forecast (\"Excess Amount\"), MediWound will accept the Purchase Order up to, but not including the Excess Amount which in any event will not exceed the Maximum Capacity. Should Vericel place a Purchase Order to procure a given Product in a given Calendar Quarter which includes an Excess Amount, MediWound shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet Vericel's request. If there is a conflict between this Agreement and any Purchase Order, this Agreement shall govern. (c) Minimum Purchase Obligation. In each Calendar Year following Vericel's submission of the first Rolling Forecast, Vericel shall issue Purchase Orders for at least [***] of the quantities of each Product set forth in the current Calendar Year of the Rolling Forecast (as was set forth at the Rolling Forecast submitted immediately prior to the beginning of such Calendar Year). (d) BARDA. As of the Effective Date, MediWound is a party to BARDA Contract HHSO100201500035C and BARDA Contract HHSO100201800023C (collectively, the 9 9012190/26 \"BARDA Agreements\") with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (\"BARDA\"). The Parties agree that until commercial obligations under such BARDA Agreements are transferred to Vericel, MediWound shall remain responsible for the supply and other obligations and shall manage the forecasts and production schedule for such BARDA Agreements. During such period, any Product ordered by BARDA from MediWound will not be included in Purchase Orders, Binding Orders, Rolling Forecasts or the minimum purchase obligation set forth in Section 2.8(c); provided that the Product ordered by BARDA from MediWound will be included in the Maximum Capacity and thus the applicable Maximum Capacity for the Binding Orders will be adjusted accordingly. If and when commercial obligations under such BARDA Agreements are transferred to Vericel, then Vericel shall become responsible for including the applicable purchases by BARDA in its Purchase Orders, Binding Orders and Rolling Forecasts and such purchases will be included in the Maximum Capacity and the minimum purchase obligation set forth in Section 2.8(c). 2.9 Delivery. (a) Shipping. MediWound shall only ship Products that have been Manufactured and released in accordance with the Specifications. Unless agreed in advance by Vericel and MediWound in writing, MediWound shall not ship (or permit such Third Party packager to ship) any Products prior to approval and release by MediWound in accordance with the Quality Agreement and Regulatory Standards. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties, Products shall be delivered to Vericel Ex-Works (Incoterms 2010), at MediWound's facility (the \"Delivery Site\") at which point, the title and risk of loss shall transfer to Vericel which shall transfer the Products from the Delivery Site in accordance with cGMP as applicable. MediWound shall notify (or cause such Third Party packager to notify) Vericel at least [***] prior to any shipment of Products. (b) Delivery Amount. MediWound shall deliver Product within [***] of the units set out on the relevant Purchase Order. To the extent that a delivery is in excess of [***] of the amount set out on the relevant Purchase Order, Vericel may accept such excess Product provided that if Vericel accepts such excess, Vericel shall be entitled, (i) where commercially reasonable for Vericel, to vary the delivery date agreed between Vericel and MediWound in accordance with Section 2.8 for the immediately following shipment(s) of the applicable Product to the extent reasonably required due to the acceptance of such excess, and (ii) to reduce subsequent Purchase Orders and take credits for the amount of excess Product received against the minimum purchase obligation set forth in Section 2.8(c). To the extent that a delivery is less than [***] but at least [***] of the amount set out on the relevant Purchase Order, Vericel shall accept such delivery and shall be entitled, (A) where commercially reasonable for Vericel, to vary the delivery date agreed between Vericel and MediWound in accordance with Section 2.8 for the immediately following shipment(s) of the applicable Product due to the acceptance of such delivery, and (B) to increase subsequent Purchase Orders with the applicable shortage quantities. (c) On Time Delivery. MediWound's performance with respect to \"on time delivery\" will be measured as delivery to Vericel [***] before or after the delivery date agreed 10 9012190/26 between Vericel and MediWound in accordance with Section 2.8; provided that MediWound shall be deemed to have made a delivery during the \"on time delivery\" window if the delay in delivery to Vericel is due to Vericel's failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement (including in connection with Vericel's review of the Batch records). 2.10 Dating. The remaining shelf-life for each Product for the Territory shall be at least [***] of the FDA approved shelf-life of such Product, as measured from the time of delivery of such Product to Vericel (the \"Minimum Shelf Life\"). 2.11 Safety Stock. MediWound shall be entitled to meet its obligation to maintain as safety stock not less than [***] of the Rolling Forecast demand of stock of each of the Key Materials (the \"Safety Stock\") so long as the Minimum Shelf Life has been satisfied by holding either Product or an equivalent quantity of Materials, or a mixture of the two. The Parties will cooperate to set minimum inventory levels of Key Materials held by Key Materials Suppliers. Vericel shall maintain an inventory of [***] supply of unlabeled or labeled Finished Product in order to supply its commercial requirements in accordance with the Rolling Forecast, which may be stored at Facility at Vericel's option, cost and risk. 2.12 Non-Conforming Product. (a) Rejection Notice. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties in writing, within [***] after receipt of a delivery of Product hereunder, Vericel shall give MediWound written notice of rejection (\"Rejection Notice\") (i) if the Product does not constitute Conforming Product (\"Non-Conforming Product\") or (ii) of any shortage in quantity of such delivery of Product. Any such Rejection Notice provided with respect to any quantity of Product shall be deemed to apply to the full Batch of such Product unless otherwise specified by Vericel. Vericel shall be deemed to have accepted such shipment of Product as Conforming Product and any shortage in quantity if it does not provide Rejection Notice within [***] after receipt of delivery describing the reasons for such rejections in reasonable detail, provided, however, that such [***] period shall not apply to any Latent Defects, in which case Vericel shall notify MediWound of any such failure as soon as reasonably possible, but in any event within [***] after the Latent Defect is confirmed by Vericel and prior to expiration of the shelf-life for such Product. (b) Disputes. In the event that MediWound disagrees with Vericel's claim that Product fails to constitute Conforming Product, then the Parties shall promptly attempt to resolve such dispute. If the Parties cannot resolve such dispute, a sample of such Product shall be submitted by MediWound and Vericel to a mutually agreeable qualified Third Party laboratory for testing against the applicable Specifications, Regulatory Standards and other standards and controls in the Quality Agreement and the test results obtained by such laboratory shall be final and controlling (absent manifest error). Test results must be furnished to both Parties within [***] of concluding such testing. The fees and expenses of such laboratory testing and any obsolescence due to short dating shall be borne entirely by the Party whose original Product analysis was in error. 11 9012190/26 (c) Remedy. On receipt of Vericel's Rejection Notice pursuant to Section 2.12(a), subject to Section 2.12(b), MediWound shall, [***] (except if such Non-Conforming Product is due to MediWound's gross negligence or willful misconduct): (i) deliver the appropriate shortage quantities of Conforming Product as promptly as possible, at no additional cost or expense (including, without limitation, freight costs) to Vericel; (ii) replace the Non-Conforming Product with Conforming Product as promptly as possible, at no additional cost or expense (including, without limitation, freight costs) to Vericel; or (iii) promptly grant Vericel a credit in an amount equal to the amount paid or payable by Vericel with respect to reasonable out of pocket expenses directly associated with the Non-Conforming Product to the extent applicable (e.g. shipment costs, destruction fees, and restocking fees) and any such shortage or Non-Conforming Product, including, without limitation, but solely in the case of Non-Conforming Product, expenses associated with destruction or return at MediWound's instruction. This subsection (iii) shall additionally apply in the event Vericel elects as its option the foregoing (i) or (ii), as applicable, and such delivery or replace of Product thereunder is not practicable within a reasonable period of time (as reasonably determined by MediWound). 2.13 Shortages. (a) Without limiting any other rights or remedies available to Vericel, in the event of any shortage in the supply of any Materials or Product, or if MediWound is for any other reason unable to supply Product in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, then MediWound will promptly notify Vericel and, in the event such inability is caused by a shortage of any Materials and/or capacity required for the Manufacture of any Product, will take all commercially reasonable steps to (i) procure adequate quantities of Materials from Third Party suppliers reasonably acceptable to Vericel, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill all Binding Orders for Product. (b) Prior to a Second Source commencing supply of Product, in the event of a shortage of (i) any Materials required to Manufacture Product or (ii) Product, MediWound will allocate the available Materials to the Manufacture of Product for sale to Vericel and will allocate the available Product for sale to Vericel, in each case ((i) or (ii)), to the extent any Binding Orders then in place prior to allocating such materials to the Manufacture of any other product (including EscharEx), or for any entity other than Vericel. (c) After a Second Source commences supply of Product, in the event of a shortage of Materials or Product, MediWound will allocate to Vericel its pro rata share of MediWound's supply of the same in a manner no less favorable than those of its equivalently situated customers or MediWound's own similarly situated products. 12 9012190/26 (d) The Parties will cooperate to discuss expansion plans, address capacity and any other product supply issues, including efficient use of resources, manufacturing schedules and shipping schedules. 2.14 Supply Failures.

Within [***] following Vericel's request, MediWound shall provide technical data and assistance in answering Vericel's questions (a) for regulatory filings and for process changes initiated by MediWound at no cost to Vericel, (b) for process changes initiated by Vericel at the cost of Vericel for the applicable number of hours at a Full Time Equivalent rate described in Schedule 4.5, (c) for new regulatory registrations, which shall be at Vericel's cost, and (d) for periodic regulatory reporting and questions from regulatory authorities, which shall be at the cost of Vericel. ARTICLE 5  PRICE AND PAYMENT TERMS 5.1 Supply Price. On a Product-by-Product basis, the price payable in U.S. Dollars by Vericel for supply of such Product for a given Calendar Year shall be as set forth on a per unit basis on Exhibit A (with respect to each Product, the \"Supply Price\"), which shall be updated on a Calendar Year basis in accordance with Section 5.2 below. 5.2 Price Mechanics. (a) Beginning on [***] (each, a \"Re-Pricing Date\"), MediWound may annually increase the Supply Price for a Calendar Year in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.2. MediWound may increase the Supply Price for a Calendar Year if the United States Producer Price Index (Chemical Manufacturing) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (the \"PPI\") [***] and (b) in the event the PPI [***]. MediWound shall give Vericel at least [***] prior written notice of any such adjustment to the Supply Price. (b) In addition to the foregoing price adjustment mechanism, MediWound may propose an adjustment to the Supply Price to reflect changes that substantially affect MediWound's costs or ability to supply Product. MediWound shall provide Vericel with written notice of such changes and its proposed adjustment and provide appropriate documentation demonstrating that the price adjustment is required. Following Vericel's receipt of such notice and documentation, the Parties will engage in good faith discussions to negotiate a mutually agreed upon adjustment to the Supply Price, if any. (c) Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the adjusted Supply Price will be the Supply Price for the next applicable Purchase Order placed after Vericel's receipt of notification of the adjusted Supply Price, and shall apply to each Purchase Order placed thereafter until the next adjustment is made (if any) in accordance with the above mechanism. 5.3 Cost Savings. Either Party may propose changes to any Manufacturing process in order to obtain efficiencies and cost savings in such process (\"Cost Savings Change\"). The proposing Party shall submit to the other Party a proposal detailing the Cost Savings Change, the implementation of such Cost Savings Change, and the analysis of the expected efficiencies and cost savings from such Cost Savings Change. If Vericel proposes a Cost Savings Change and (a) MediWound determines it is technically able to implement the Cost Savings Change, (b) the Cost Savings Change would not materially adversely affect the applicable Facility, and (c) Vericel agrees to pay the costs to implement such Costs Saving Change as an Additional Service Fee, 18 9012190/26 MediWound shall agree to implement such proposed change which MediWound shall not unreasonably decline to implement. If MediWound proposes a Cost Savings Change and the Parties agree to its implementation, (i) Vericel shall pay MediWound the agreed amount to implement such change as an Additional Service Fee prior to the implementation of such Cost Savings Change; and (ii) MediWound shall make its reasonable commercial efforts to implement such Cost Savings Change pursuant to a mutually agreed upon schedule. In the event cost savings are actually achieved, then the cost saving will be [***] between the Parties (i.e. [***] of the cost savings shall be added to the new discounted Supply Price). 5.4 Payments. Unless specified otherwise, any payment to be made by Vericel under this Agreement shall be made within [***] from date of invoice. It is hereby agreed that the invoice with respect to any shipment will be issued upon the delivery date. The Parties' respective rights and responsibilities under Sections 5.6.5 and 5.6.6 of the License Agreement shall apply as such Section pertains to the Parties' performance under this Agreement, and are hereby incorporated by reference. 5.5 Late Payments. Any payments due under this Agreement shall be due on such date as specified in this Agreement and, in the event such date is not a Business Day, then the next succeeding Business Day. In the event that any payment due under this Agreement is not made when due, the amount due shall accrue interest beginning on the [***] following the date on which such payment was due, calculated at the [***] for the due date, or, if lower, the maximum rate permitted by law, calculated from the due date until paid in full. Each payment made after the due date shall be accompanied by all interest so accrued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party shall have recourse to any other remedy available at law or in equity with respect to any delinquent payment, subject to the terms of this Agreement. 5.6 Taxes. Vericel shall be responsible for the payment of any value added or similar tax (but excluding, for avoidance of doubt, any tax on the income of MediWound) on the Products delivered by MediWound to Vericel, to the extent such taxes are itemized and included on a valid invoice and required to be collected from Vericel under applicable Law. In addition, in the event any payments made by Vericel pursuant to this Agreement become subject to withholding taxes under the Laws or regulations of any jurisdiction or Governmental Authority, Vericel shall deduct and withhold the amount of such taxes for the account of MediWound to the extent required by applicable Laws or regulations; such amounts payable to MediWound shall be reduced by the amount of taxes deducted and withheld; and Vericel shall pay the amounts of such taxes to the proper Governmental Authority in a timely manner and transmit to MediWound an official tax certificate or other evidence of such tax obligations together with proof of payment from the relevant Governmental Authority of all amounts deducted and withheld. Any such withholding taxes required under applicable Laws or regulations to be paid or withheld shall be an expense of, and borne solely by, MediWound. Each Party agrees to cooperate with the other Party in claiming refunds or exemptions from such deductions or withholdings under any relevant agreement or treaty which is in effect. The Parties shall discuss applicable mechanisms for minimizing such taxes to the extent possible in compliance with applicable Laws. Vericel will provide MediWound with reasonable assistance to enable MediWound to recover such taxes as permitted by applicable Laws or regulations. 19 9012190/26 ARTICLE 6 REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS 6.1 Mutual Representations and Warranties.

(a) Notice. Each Party will notify the other Party in writing in the event it becomes aware of a claim for which indemnification may be sought hereunder. In the event that any Third Party asserts a claim or other proceeding (including any governmental investigation) with respect to any matter for which a Party (the \"Indemnified Party\") is entitled to indemnification hereunder (a \"Third Party Claim\"), then the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Party obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") thereof; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then only to the extent that) the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby. (b) Control. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, exercisable by notice to the Indemnified Party within [***] after receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of or assertion of any Third Party Claim, to assume direction and control of the defense, litigation, settlement, appeal or other disposition of the Third Party Claim (including the right to settle the claim solely for monetary consideration) with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party; provided that (i) the Indemnifying Party has sufficient financial resources, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, to satisfy the amount of any adverse monetary judgment that is sought, (ii) the Third Party Claim seeks solely monetary damages and (iii) the Indemnifying Party expressly agrees in writing that as between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be solely obligated to satisfy and discharge the Third Party Claim in full (the conditions set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above are collectively referred to as the \"Litigation Conditions\"). Within [***] after the Indemnifying Party has given notice to the Indemnified Party of its exercise of its right to defend a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give notice to the Indemnifying Party of any objection thereto based upon the Litigation Conditions. If the Indemnified Party reasonably so objects, the Indemnified Party shall continue to defend the Third Party Claim, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, until such time as 22 9012190/26 such objection is withdrawn. If no such notice is given, or if any such objection is withdrawn, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at its sole cost and expense, to assume direction and control of such defense, with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. During such time as the Indemnifying Party is controlling the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate, and shall cause its Affiliates and agents to cooperate upon request of the Indemnifying Party, in the defense or prosecution of the Third Party Claim, including by furnishing such records, information and testimony and attending such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals as may reasonably be requested by the Indemnifying Party.

Each of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall not make any admission of liability in respect of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the other party, and the Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate liabilities arising from such Third Party Claim. 7.5 Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES, AND EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS, ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE MANUFACTURE AND SUPPLY OF PRODUCT HEREUNDER), EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, ANY WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 7.6 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

The term of this Agreement will commence upon the Effective Date and will continue until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Effective Date, unless earlier terminated or extended under this Article 8 (the \"Initial Term\"). At least twenty-four (24) months from the end of the Initial Term, Vericel shall provide MediWound notice whether Vericel elects to extend the Initial Term of the Agreement by an additional twenty four (24) months. After the Initial Term (including any extension thereto made in accordance with the preceding sentence), the Agreement may be extended on a yearly basis up to ten (10) years at Vericel's sole discretion, with renewal notice to be provided to MediWound no later than twelve (12) months prior to the expiry of any yearly extension (the \"Renewal Term\", and the Initial Term, together with the Renewal Term, if any, the \"Term\"); provided that unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the Term of this Agreement (including the Initial Term, any extension of the Initial Term and any Renewal Terms) shall be no more than fifteen (15) years in total. 8.2 Automatic Termination. This Agreement will automatically immediately terminate in the event of the expiration or termination of the License Agreement. 8.3 Termination for Breach. Subject to the provisions of Article 10 below, either Party may terminate this Agreement in its entirety if the other Party materially breaches a material provision and does not cure such breach, or does not take reasonable steps required under the circumstances to cure such breach going forward, within [***] after receiving notice of the breach. 8.4 Termination by Vericel. Following the Initial Term, Vericel may, without penalty or prejudice to any other rights or remedies Vericel may have, in its sole discretion terminate or reduce the scope of any individual activities contemplated by this Agreement or any Additional Service or with respect to any Product or terminate this Agreement as a whole with or without cause, upon [***] prior written notice of such termination or reduction (which such written notice may be provided during the Initial Term). 8.5 Termination by MediWound. Following the Initial Term, MediWound may terminate this Agreement by notice in writing to Vericel upon on at least [***] advanced written notice (or such longer period of time as reasonably necessary to avoid a supply disruption) if MediWound determines to cease Manufacturing the applicable Product for the Territory, but in such case MediWound will reasonably cooperate with Vericel to enable Vericel to establish its own source for the Product (including, to the extent requested by Vericel and within 24 9012190/26 MediWound's ability to do so, by transferring MediWound's applicable Third Party manufacturing relationships to Vericel). 8.6 Effects of Termination. Any expiration or termination of this Agreement shall not affect any claims that have accrued or outstanding obligations or payments due hereunder prior to such termination or expiration, nor shall it prejudice any other remedies that the Parties may have under this Agreement. In addition, upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement: (a) if Vericel terminates the Agreement for breach or MediWound terminates in accordance with Section 8.5, Vericel shall have the option of [***] (b) Vericel shall pay to MediWound: (i) all amounts outstanding and remaining to be paid for Product supplied prior to such expiration or termination or under any other obligation under the Agreement; (ii) all amounts for Product in the Binding Forecasts and Binding Orders prior to the expiration or termination, provided that MediWound delivers such Product in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (iii) all amounts representing the purchase by MediWound of Materials in reliance upon the Binding Forecasts and Binding Orders (if MediWound is unable to cancel (without incurring any costs) or otherwise use such Materials); and (iv) all amounts representing remaining inventory of Product and all Product work in process undertaken in accordance with the Binding Forecasts or Binding Orders or undertaken otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (c) Following expiration of the Royalty Term (as defined in the License Agreement) for any Licensed Product in a given country, the license granted to Vericel under Section 9.1 of this Agreement with respect to such Licensed Product in such country shall automatically become fully paid-up, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty-free. 8.7 Survival. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, the following terms of this Agreement shall survive: Article 1, Sections 3.2, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6, Article 7, Article 8, Sections 9.1 and 9.2 (except in the event of termination of the License Agreement under Section 9.2, 9.3 or 9.4 thereof), Section 9.3, Article 10, and Article 11. ARTICLE 9 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS 9.1 Manufacturing License Grant. Subject to the terms herein, MediWound hereby grants to Vericel a non-exclusive, sublicensable (subject to Section 4.2 of the License Agreement) license under the MediWound Technology and MediWound's interest in the Joint Technology, to Manufacture and have Manufactured Licensed Products in the Territory for use in the Field in the Territory. 9.2 Trademarks License Grant. MediWound hereby grants to Vericel an exclusive (even as to MediWound), sublicensable, royalty- free, fully paid-up, license in the Territory to use the Licensed Trademarks (as defined in the License Agreement) and a non- exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, license to use the MediWound name and trademark, in 25 9012190/26 each case, in connection with the Manufacture of Licensed Products in or for the Territory. All uses of the Licensed Trademarks by Vericel (and its Affiliates, Sublicensees and Distributors) in connection with the Manufacture of Licensed Products in or for the Territory shall be in accordance with Regulatory Approvals and all applicable Laws and MediWound's quality control guidelines for the Licensed Trademarks, as may be amended from time to time. Vericel (and its Affiliates) shall only use the Licensed Trademarks licensed hereunder in connection with the Manufacture of Licensed Products in the Territory. Vericel shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates, Sublicensee and Distributors not to) use such Licensed Trademarks to identify, or in connection with the marketing of, any other products. 9.1 Ownership. Ownership of all inventions and discoveries made by the Parties in the course of Manufacturing and supply of the Product hereunder (including Manufacture and supply of Product) shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the License Agreement. ARTICLE 10  FORCE MAJEURE 10.1 Excusing Performance. Neither Party shall be liable for the failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement to the extent such failure is due to events beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing Party, including fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, embargoes, shortages, epidemics, quarantines, war, acts of war (whether war be declared or not), terrorist acts, insurrections, riots, civil commotion, strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances involving the workforce of any Third Party, or acts of God (a \"Force Majeure Event\"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event will not excuse or prevent a failure of MediWound to deliver Product from being deemed a \"Supply Failure\" or otherwise limit Vericel's rights, to the extent applicable, under Section 2.13. 10.2 Notice of Force Majeure Event. A Party claiming a right to be excused from performance under Section 10.1 shall immediately notify the other Party in writing of the extent of its inability to perform, which notice shall specify the Force Majeure Event and the estimated likely period of time during which its performance will be affected. 10.3 Resumption; Termination. A non-performing Party as a result of a Force Majeure Event shall use reasonable best efforts, at its own expense, to eliminate the Force Majeure Event and to mitigate the effect of such cause and resume performance under this Agreement, in each case, as soon as practicable and for as long as such Force Majeure Event continues. Further, consistent with diligent risk management practices, MediWound will keep current a risk management program. If MediWound is affected by any Force Majeure Event, MediWound agrees to perform its obligations under this Section 10.3 to mitigate the effect thereof and resume performance under this Agreement in the same manner as MediWound would use to resolve any similar disruptions affecting its own products (including EscharEx). MediWound shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the impact of the Force Majeure Event shall not be relatively greater for Vericel than it is for MediWound with respect to MediWound's products (including EscharEx). 26 9012190/26 ARTICLE 11  MISCELLANEOUS 11.1 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any interest hereunder shall be assignable by a Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, except as follows: (a) such Party may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates, provided that the assignee shall expressly agree to be bound by such Party's obligations under this Agreement and that such Party shall remain liable for all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (b) either Party may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to a Third Party in connection with a permitted assignment or other permitted transfer of the License Agreement. Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of any assignment or transfer under the provisions of this Section 11.1. This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Parties and the name of a Party appearing herein shall be deemed to include the names of such Party's successors and permitted assigns to the extent necessary to carry out the intent of this Agreement. Any assignment not in accordance with this Section 11.1 shall be void. 11.2 Further Actions. Each Party agrees to execute, acknowledge and deliver such further instruments, and to do all such other acts, as may be necessary or appropriate in order to carry out the purposes and intent of the Agreement. 11.3 Notices.

The waiver by either of the Parties of any breach of any provision hereof by the other Party shall not be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach of such provision or a waiver of the provision itself. 11.6 Severability. If any clause or portion thereof in this Agreement is for any reason held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the same shall not affect any other portion of this Agreement, as it is the intent of the Parties that this Agreement shall be construed in such fashion as to maintain its existence, validity and enforceability to the greatest extent possible. In any such event, this Agreement shall be construed as if such clause of portion thereof had never been contained in this Agreement, and there shall be deemed substituted therefor such provision as will most nearly carry out the intent of the Parties as expressed in this Agreement to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. 11.7 Descriptive Headings.

Counterparts may be signed and delivered by facsimile or PDF file, each of which shall be binding when received by the applicable Party. 11.14 No Third Party Rights or Obligations.
